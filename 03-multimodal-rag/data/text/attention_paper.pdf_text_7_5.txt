Model Variations
To evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model
in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the
development set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no
checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.
In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,
keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head
attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality
