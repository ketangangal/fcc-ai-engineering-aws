Label Smoothing
During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [30]. This
hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.

Machine Translation
On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)
in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0
BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The conﬁguration of this model
