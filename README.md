This comprehensive course focuses on cutting-edge AI techniques, including **LangChain** integration with **Amazon Bedrock** and **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Designed for AI enthusiasts and professionals, this course covers advanced techniques in **RAG**, **Multimodal RAG**, and model **fine-tuning** using Amazon Bedrock.

## üéØ Overview

This course dives deep into the world of AI engineering, leveraging the power of AWS to build sophisticated AI systems. With a strong focus on Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), you'll learn to:

- Implement advanced RAG techniques using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) and [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/)
- Use different foundational models with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
- Create powerful multimodal AI systems capable of processing both text and image data
- Explore cutting-edge Multimodal RAG techniques for enhanced information retrieval and generation with [OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/)
- Fine-tune large language models for specific tasks and domains with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
- Implement practical Multimodal RAG applications using AWS services and tools, like Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and more
- Evaluate and optimize AI model performance for production environments

Our course emphasizes hands-on experience with Multimodal RAG, enabling you to build context-aware AI systems that can understand and process both textual and visual information effectively.
