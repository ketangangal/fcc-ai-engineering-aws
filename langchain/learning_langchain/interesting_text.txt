The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The early bird catches the worm.
Actions speak louder than words.
Fortune favors the bold.
