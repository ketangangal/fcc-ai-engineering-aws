In form and content, the justifications may vary by agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides yearly instructions to agencies for producing materials to be included in the President's budget submission and agency budget justifications. Each summer, OMB issues these instructions as part of a document entitled, Circular No. A-11: Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget . The release of budget justifications occurs soon after the release of the President's annual budget submission and in advance of congressional hearings on agency budget requests. Agencies submit budget justifications to the appropriations subcommittees to support agency testimony and inform congressional deliberations. Beginning with the FY2008 executive budget cycle, agencies have also been required to post their congressional budget justification materials on the internet within two weeks of transmittal to Congress. Website links to FY2020 budget justification documents for each of the 15 executive departments and 9 selected independent agencies are provided below.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nA private bill is one that provides benefits to specified individuals (including corporate bodies). Individuals sometimes request relief through private law when administrative or legal remedies are exhausted, but Congress seems more often to view private legislation as appropriate when no other remedy is available and when enactment would, in a broad sense, afford equity. From 1817 through 1971, most Congresses enacted hundreds of private laws, but since then the number has declined significantly as Congress has expanded administrative discretion to deal with many of the situations that tended to give rise to private bills. Since 2007, four private laws have been enacted. Private provisions are also occasionally included in public legislation. The Senate considers private bills using the same procedures that are used to consider other legislation. No House rule defines what bills qualify as private, but most private bills have official titles stating them to be \"for the relief of\" named individuals. House Rule XII, clause 4, prohibits the introduction or consideration of private bills for granting pensions, constructing certain bridges, correcting military or naval records, or settling claims eligible for action under the Tort Claims Act ( U.S. Code , Title 28). Subjects of contemporary private bills (and House committees receiving referral of those bills) include the following: Immigration (e.g., residency status, visa classification): Judiciary Domestic claims against the government: Judiciary Foreign claims against the government: Foreign Affairs Patents and copyrights: Judiciary Vessel documentation: Transportation and Infrastructure Taxation (e.g., income tax liability, tariff exemptions): Ways and Means Public lands (e.g., sales, claims, exchanges, mineral leases): Natural Resources Veterans' benefits: Veterans' Affairs Civil Service status: Oversight and Reform Medical (e.g., drug approvals, HMO enrollment requirements): Energy and Commerce Military decorations: Armed Services Private bills are introduced and referred in the same way as other measures. They are commonly introduced by the Member who represents the individual to be benefitted. Seldom are companion bills introduced in both chambers. Although House Rule XII, clause 7, permits no cosponsors on private bills, cosponsors have occasionally appeared on private bills that attract broad interest. Immigration and claims matters have long been the most common subjects of private bills. The Committee on the Judiciary refers these to its Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, which handles them routinely under established committee rules. It generally takes no action on a private bill unless its sponsor submits specified documentation and requests a hearing. The sponsor is generally the only witness at such a hearing. The subcommittee makes available to Member offices information on what documentation it requires and the kinds of bills on which it is likely to take favorable action. It usually declines to report a bill if its records show few precedents for favorable House action in similar cases. Panels that handle other kinds of private legislation have no similarly institutionalized procedures. House Rule XV, clause 5, establishes special procedures for the consideration of private bills. When reported, private bills go on a dedicated calendar, the Private Calendar (House Rule XIII, clause 1). On the first Tuesday of each month, the Speaker is to direct the Clerk to call the bills and resolutions that are pending on the Private Calendar. Each bill is called up automatically in the order in which it was reported and placed on the Calendar. The bills are considered under a hybrid set of procedures known as \"the House as in Committee of the Whole,\" meaning that there is no period of general debate, but debate and amendment may occur under the five-minute rule. Usually, however, no debate occurs, and private measures are disposed of by voice vote. At his or her discretion, the Speaker may also, on any other day of the month, call up for consideration a bill or resolution that has been pending on the Private Calendar for at least seven days, providing he or she has given two legislative days' notice of his or her intention to do so. During the call of the Private Calendar, if two Members object to the consideration of any bill, it is automatically recommitted. During a Congress, each party is to appoint official \"objectors\" who are responsible for examining bills on the Private Calendar and objecting to those they deem inappropriate. Sometimes, a member of a subcommittee dealing with immigration or claims has served simultaneously as an official objector. In practice, instead of objecting, objectors may ask that a bill be passed \"over, without prejudice,\" which gives sponsors an opportunity to discuss concerns with them informally before the next calendar call. If a private bill is recommitted, the committee may re-report it as a paragraph of an omnibus private bill, which has priority for consideration under Rule XV. At this stage, the substance of each original private bill may be defeated by majority vote by means of a motion to strike the paragraph out of the omnibus bill. Otherwise, each paragraph may be amended only by reducing amounts of money or providing limitations. After an omnibus private bill is passed, it is broken up again into separate bills for further action. In recent practice, committees seldom re-report private measures once they are recommitted, and the House does not appear to have considered an omnibus private bill in decades. The House has sometimes considered private bills using other parliamentary mechanisms, such as the Suspension of the Rules procedure or by unanimous consent. Further proceedings on private bills follow the general lawmaking process. Presidents have vetoed private bills, sometimes by pocket veto. Otherwise, Congress may override the veto in the same way as with public measures. Either house of Congress may also, by resolution, refer a private claims bill to the Court of Claims for a recommendation from a trial commissioner. These recommendations are requested occasionally and are strictly advisory, but they are often followed when requested.", "completion": "response:\n\nA private bill is one that provides benefits to specified individuals (including corporate bodies).

See Table 1 for a list of House bills and Table 2 for a list of Senate bills in the 116 th Congress . Thirty-one bills received committee consideration or passed one or both chambers in the 115 th Congress. Five bills became public laws: On September 28, 2018, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act was signed into law ( P.L. 115-246 ). The law establishes a Department of Energy policy for science and energy research and development programs; reforms National Laboratory management and technology transfer programs; and directs DOE to report to Congress on integrated research programs in cybersecurity and national security, among other issues. On August 13, 2018, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 was signed into law ( P.L. 115-232 ). The bill authorizes appropriations and sets forth policies regarding Department of Defense's military activities, including cybersecurity matters. On December 12, 2017, the President signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 ( P.L. 115-91 ), which establishes several cybersecurity efforts and new rules and programs related to information security. These include an official ban on Kaspersky Lab software (Section 1634); definition by the President of \"cyberwar\" (Section 1633); the Pentagon's reexamination of the Defense Department's internal organizational structure surrounding its cybersecurity-related missions (Section 1641, Section 1644, and others); and the National Science Foundation and Office of Personnel Management's launch of a joint pilot scholarship program aimed at educating and recruiting talent directly out of universities (Section 1649). On November 21, 2017, the FITARA Enhancement Act of 2017 became law ( P.L. 115-88 ). Among other things, it requires the chief information officer of each covered agency for information technology to conduct a risk management review of those investments that have received a high-risk rating for four consecutive quarters. On November 2, 2017, Congress passed the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-76 ), which authorizes a National Computer Forensics Institute within the U.S. Secret Service. The institute is to disseminate information related to the investigation and prevention of cyber and electronic crime and related threats.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nBetween 1819 and 1857, the room currently called Statuary Hall served as the Hall of the House of Representatives. Upon the completion of the current House chamber in 1857, the fate of the old \"Hall of the House\" was debated for many years. Perhaps the simplest was that it be converted into additional space for the Library of Congress, which was still housed in the Capitol. More drastic was the suggestion that the entire Hall be dismantled and replaced by two floors of committee rooms. Eventually, the idea of using the chamber as an art gallery was approved, and works intended for the Capitol extensions were put on exhibit; among these was the plaster model for the Statue of Freedom, which was later cast in bronze for the Capitol dome. The lack of wall space effectively prevented the hanging of large paintings, but the room seemed well suited to the display of statuary. Beginning in November 1879, Statuary Hall was first used for events. The first two events were a reception and dinner for the Society of the Army of the Cumberland on November 20, 1879, and a ceremony to close the Centennial Safe on November 22, 1879. Today, Statuary Hall is the home to many of the statues in the National Statuary Hall collection, which consists of two statues from each state. A room in the House Wing of the Capitol may be reserved in one of two ways: through a chamber resolution or pursuant to the Speaker's authority. House Rule I, clause 3 provides the Speaker with the authority to assign unappropriated rooms (i.e., not already assigned to a committee, House leadership, or an officer of the House). House Rule I, clause 3 states Except as otherwise provided by rule or law, the Speaker shall have general control of the Hall of the House, the corridors and passages in the part of the Capitol assigned to the use of the House, and the disposal of unappropriated rooms in that part of the Capitol. For rooms jointly controlled by the House and Senate (e.g., the Rotunda and Emancipation Hall), a concurrent resolution is generally required to authorize use. Initially adopted in 1811 to provide the Speaker with approval authority over events in the House chamber, clause 3 was last amended in 1911, to provide the Speaker with control over unappropriated rooms elsewhere in the House Wing of the Capitol. Since 1911, the Speaker has generally authorized use of rooms in the House Wing of the Capitol not otherwise appropriated. Since 2005, 170 events have been held in Statuary Hall. The House Sergeant at Arms, whose office provided data for this report, defines an event as activity that prevents public access to Statuary Hall for a period of time. As a result, activities such as a brief wreath laying at a particular statue are not included. Table 1 reports the total number of events held in Statuary Hall since 2005. The Appendix provides the date of each event and a brief description. Following receipt of the data from the House Sergeant at Arms, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) examined the events and divided them into four categories: (1) receptions and dinners, (2) ceremonies, (3) media events, and (4) memorial services. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category and examples of activities. Table 2 reports the number of events since 2005, by category. The largest percentage of events held in Statuary Hall (57.6%) were receptions or dinners, hosted by both official congressional entities and private groups. For example, the Joint Congressional Committee on the Inaugural Ceremonies held the Inaugural Luncheon in Statuary Hall in 2005, 2009, and 2013; and the Capitol Historical Society held a reception for new Members of Congress in the Hall in 2005 and 2013. Ceremonies account for 28.8% of the events held in Statuary Hall since 2005. These ceremonies include presentations of awards, unveiling of official portraits, commemorations of event anniversaries, formal wreath layings, and prayer services. For example, the annual National Moment of Remembrance is held in Statuary Hall. In addition, prior to moving the statue to Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Visitor Center, an annual lei draping ceremony at King Kamehameha statue was held in Statuary Hall. Statuary Hall has also been occasionally used as the location for media availability, primarily after a presidential address to a joint session of Congress in the House chamber. Media events represent 5.9% of the events held in Statuary Hall. Since 2005, 13 memorial services (7.6%) for current or former Members of Congress have been held in Statuary Hall: for Representatives Robert Matsui (January 5, 2005); Juanita Millender-McDonald (May 17, 2007); Tom Lantos (February 14, 2008); Stephanie Tubbs Jones (September 10, 2008); John P. Murtha (March 30, 2010); Donald M. Payne (April 25, 2012); Speaker Thomas Foley (October 29, 2013); Mark Takai (September 14, 2016); Robert Michel (March 9, 2017); Louise Slaughter (April 18, 2018); and since 2016, an annual U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress memorial service to honor former Members who died in the past year.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), most recently comprehensively amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ), is the primary source of federal aid to elementary and secondary education. Title I-A is the largest program in the ESEA, funded at $15.8 billion for FY2018. Title I-A is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending elementary and secondary schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) determines Title I-A grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on four separate funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). This report provides estimated FY2018 state grant amounts under each of the four formulas used to determine Title I-A grants. For a general overview of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44164, ESEA Title I-A Formulas: In Brief . For a more detailed discussion of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44461, Allocation of Funds Under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act . Under Title I-A, funds are allocated to LEAs via state educational agencies (SEAs) using the four Title I-A formulas. Annual appropriations bills specify portions of each year's Title I-A appropriation to be allocated to LEAs and states under each of the formulas. In FY2018, about 41% of Title I-A appropriations were allocated through the Basic Grants formula, 9% through the Concentration Grants formula, and 25% each through the Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas. Once funds reach LEAs, the amounts allocated under the four formulas are combined and used jointly. For each formula, a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a \"formula child count,\" consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children living in families in poverty, by an \"expenditure factor\" based on state average per pupil expenditures for public elementary and secondary education. In some of the Title I-A formulas, additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor to determine a maximum grant amount. These maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula, taking into account a variety of state and LEA minimum grant provisions. In general, LEAs must have a minimum number of formula children and/or a minimum formula child rate to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific Title I-A formula. Some LEAs may qualify for a grant under only one formula, while other LEAs may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas. Under three of the formulasâ€”Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grantsâ€”funds are initially calculated at the LEA level. State grants are the total of allocations for all LEAs in the state, adjusted for state minimum grant provisions. Under EFIG, grants are first calculated for each state overall and then are subsequently suballocated to LEAs within the state using a different formula. FY2018 grants included in this report were calculated by ED. The percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas was calculated by CRS for each state by dividing the total grant received by the total amount allocated under each formula. Table 1 provides each state's estimated grant amount and percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas for FY2018. Total Title I-A grants for each state, calculated by summing the state level grant for each of the four formulas, are also shown in Table 1 . Overall, California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount ($2.0 billion) and, as a result, the largest percentage share (12.76%) of Title I-A grants. Wyoming received the smallest total Title I-A grant amount ($35.9 million) and, as a result, the smallest percentage share (0.23%) of Title I-A grants. In general, grant amounts for states vary among formulas due to the different allocation amounts for the formulas. For example, the Basic Grant formula receives a greater share of overall Title I-A appropriations than the Concentration Grant formula, so states generally receive higher estimated grant amounts under the Basic Grant formula than under the Concentration Grant formula. Among states, Title I-A grant amounts and the percentage shares of funds vary due to the different characteristics of each state. For example, Texas has a larger population of children included in the formula calculations than North Carolina and, therefore, is estimated to receive a higher estimated grant amount and larger share of Title I-A funds. Within a state, the percentage share of funds allocated may vary by formula, as certain formulas are more favorable to certain types of states (e.g., EFIG is generally more favorable to states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their LEAs). If a state's share of a given Title I-A formula exceeds its share of overall Title I-A funds, this is generally an indication that this particular formula is more favorable to the state than formulas under which the state's share of funds is below its overall share of Title I-A funds. For example, Florida, Nevada, New York, and Texas are estimated to receive a higher percentage share of Targeted Grants than of overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Targeted Grant formula is more favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be. At the same time, all four states are estimated to receive a smaller percentage share of Basic Grants than of overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Basic Grant formula is less favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be. In states that are estimated to receive a minimum grant under all four formulas (North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming), the shares under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas are greater than under the Basic Grant or Concentration Grant formulas, due to higher state minimums under these formulas. If a state received the minimum grant under a given Title I-A formula, the grant amount is denoted with an asterisk (*) in Table 1 . ", "completion": "response:\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), most recently comprehensively amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95), is the primary source of federal aid to K-12 education. The Title I-A program is the largest grant program authorized under the ESEA and was funded at $15.8 billion for FY2018. It is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending elementary and secondary schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. Under current law, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) determines Title I-A grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on four separate funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). The four Title I-A formulas have somewhat distinct allocation patterns, providing varying shares of allocated funds to different types of states. Thus, for some states, certain formulas are more favorable than others. This report provides FY2018 state grant amounts under each of the four formulas used to determine Title I-A grants. Overall, California received the largest FY2018 Title I-A grant amount ($2.0 billion, or 12.76% of total Title I-A grants). Wyoming received the smallest FY2018 Title I-A grant amount ($35.9 million, or 0.23% of total Title I-A grants)."}
