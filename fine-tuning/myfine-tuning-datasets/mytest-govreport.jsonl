Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nR ecently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it would only accept mailed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and not those submitted electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has adopted a contrasting policy, saying that CDC would not be able to respond to mailed FOIA requests and that requests should be placed electronically. These examples of differing policies, among others examples not mentioned, when combined with agencies' adoption of additional telework flexibilities , raise questions about how agencies will be responding to FOIA requests in the near future. This report provides an overview of the FOIA request process and actual and potential FOIA request processing changes within federal government agencies as a result of COVID-19. FOIA does not require requests for agency information to be submitted in a particular format, only that the request reasonably describes the records sought and complies with agency regulations. Most agencies accept requests via mail, email, web form, or fax. The statute also requires the affirmative disclosure of certain categories of agency information, such as \"substantive rules of general applicability,\" \"rules of procedure,\" and, since 2016, records requested three or more times. While the text of FOIA does not specifically dictate the method in which the public must request information from an agency, FOIA does prescribe how an agency is to respond to the request. From an administrative perspective, FOIA directs the amount of time an agency has to respond to a request, defines whether and how an agency may recoup costs for providing services in response to a request, and provides nine instances where an agency may exempt information from public disclosure. After an agency receives a request, the agency is to inform the requester of its receipt. Generally, an agency is to respond to a correctly routed, simple request within 20 days with a determination of the scope of the documents the agency will produce and any exemptions it will apply to withhold records or information. Complex or incorrectly routed requests may be subject to additional days of processing, per the statute (5 U.S.C. Â§552(a)(6)). Also, agencies managing backlog s of FOIA requests do not always process requests within the statutory period. When completed, a written response may provide the information requested or some of the information requested with redactions per one of FOIA's nine exemptions, inform the requester that the agency does not have responsive records, or deny a request entirely due to one of the nine exemptions. Requesters may administratively appeal an agency's adverse decision. Government information requests through FOIA may be impacted by COVID-19 in two ways: (1) certain types of information related to the outbreak may be eligible for expedited consideration; and (2) processes for locating information may change due to employees working remotely or on administrative leave. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Â§552(a)(6)(E), processing of FOIA requests is to be expedited as soon as practicable in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. Statute defines a \"compelling need\" as a case where the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to someone's life or physical safety; or there is an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, but only if the request is made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information. Agencies may also establish additional standards for granting expedited processing. Whereas agencies are to initially respond to most FOIA requests within 20 days, they must determine whether to grant expedited processing within 10 days. Locating information responsive to a FOIA request requires employees and systems to search and review the information . Additionally, not all agency information is created or available in a digital format. Per the Department of Justice's FOIA.gov portal, There is no central office in the government that handles FOIA requests for all federal departments and agencies.... There are many different officials at these agencies who work hard every day to make sure that the FOIA works. There are the FOIA professionals who search for and process records in response to FOIA requests, FOIA Contacts and FOIA Public Liaisons who work with FOIA requesters to answer questions and resolve concerns, and Chief FOIA Officers who oversee their agency's compliance with the FOIA. Because of the decentralized FOIA process at federal agencies, multiple physical and digital systems and many people may be involved in processing a single request. However, given the work flexibilities at many agencies due to COVID-19, some or all of the members of an agency's FOIA team may currently be working offsite. If a record responsive to a request is only available on-site in a paper format, that record's practical availability may be limited by these conditions. While challenges in locating responsive information may occur at any agency, responses to requests for information during the COVID-19 outbreak have varied. CRS performed a search of federal department websites and their components. As of March 26, 2020, CRS identified statements by 13 agencies regarding COVID-19's impact on FOIA request processing. Table 1 presents these recent statements regarding the impact of COVID-19 or simply changes in agencies' abilities to process FOIA requests, provides Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) citations to each agency's policy regarding expedited FOIA requests, and notes whether the agency has made additional allowances for expediting requests. The table should be considered a snapshot in time, as agencies may update or change their statements. Of the 13 agencies identified, 8 altered the transmission method by which a FOIA request should be submitted. Some statements also discuss current operating status, and mention anticipated delays due to COVID-19. Six of the identified agencies have additional allowances for expediting requests: U.S. Air Force, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Labor, Department of Veterans Affairs, National Archives and Records Administration, and Office of Government Information Services. Of the six agencies that established additional allowances for expediting requests, five permit expediting cases where due process rights would be impacted, four permit expediting cases where there exist possible questions affecting public confidence in the federal government's integrity, one permits expediting due to humanitarian needs, and one permits expediting at the discretion of the agency's FOIA Officer. The exact language from the C.F.R. is provided in Table 1 below.", "completion": "response:\n\nAs federal agencies adjust their operations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, activities related to the processing and release of government information are also changing. Agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice, the U.S. Postal Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within the Department of Health and Human Services, among others, have announced changes to their processing of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests due to the pandemic. Government information requests through FOIA may be impacted by COVID-19 in two ways. First, certain types of information related to the outbreak may be eligible for expedited consideration; FOIA requests are to be expedited as soon as practicable in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. Second, processes for locating information may change due to employees working remotely or on administrative leave. This In Brief report provides an overview of the typical FOIA request process and usual conditions for requesting expedited processing of a request. The report then provides analysis of the impact of agency procedures in response to the pandemic on government information availability, and concludes with a survey of announced agency processing alterations."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) programs were reorganized starting with the FY2016 request. There are two main mission areas under the DNN appropriation: the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Program and the Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program (NCTIR). NCTIR was previously funded under Weapons Activities. According to the FY2016 budget justification, \"These transfers align all NNSA funding to prevent, counter, and respond to nuclear proliferation and terrorism in one appropriation.\" The DNN Program is now divided into six functional areas: Materials Management and Minimization (M3) conducts activities to reduce and, where possible, eliminate stockpiles of weapons-useable material around the world. Major activities include conversion of reactors that use highly enriched uranium (useable for weapons) to low enriched uranium, removal and consolidation of nuclear material stockpiles, and disposition of excess nuclear materials. Global Material Security has three major program elements: international nuclear security, radiological security, and nuclear smuggling detection and deterrence. Activities toward achieving those goals include the provision of equipment and training, workshops and exercises, and collaboration with international organizations. Nonproliferation and Arms Control implements programs that aim to strengthen international nuclear safeguards, control the spread of dual-use technologies and expertise, and verify nuclear reductions and compliance with treaties and agreements. This program conducts reviews of nuclear export applications and technology transfer authorizations. National Technical Nuclear Forensics Research and Development (NTNF R&D ) examines and evaluates nuclear materials and devices, nuclear test explosions or radiological dispersals, and post-detonation debris through nuclear forensics development at the national laboratories. The program includes a field response capability to assist the interagency in the event of a nuclear or radiological incident. Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development ( DNN R&D ) advances U.S. capabilities to detect and characterize global nuclear security threats such as foreign nuclear material and weapons production, diversion of special nuclear material, and nuclear detonations. The Nonproliferation Construction program consists of the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Project (SPD) and the Mixed-Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), which was to be built in South Carolina to convert surplus weapons plutonium into nuclear reactor fuel. This project was terminated and replaced with a different disposal method (see below). The Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program (NCTIR) evaluates nuclear and radiological threats and develops emergency preparedness plans, including organizing scientific teams to provide rapid response to nuclear or radiological incidents or accidents worldwide. The FY2021 request for DNN appropriations totaled $2.031 billion, reflecting a 6.2% decrease from FY2020-enacted levels. The budget justification says that this decrease is mainly due to the \"completion of funding for contractual termination\" of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MOX) project at the Savannah River Site. Funding for that program was decreased by 50% (-$150 million). A $42 million, or 9.65%, decrease to the Global Material Security program was due to an increase in FY2020 funds for the Cesium Irradiator Replace Program. The budget proposal requests a $37.2 million, or 10%, increase in funding for the Material Management Minimization program. The increase is mainly in the conversion subprogram, which is working to establish non-HEU based molybdenum-99 production technologies in the United States. The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Research and Development (NTNF R&D) is a new program in FY2021. The budget request says that the program will allow NNSA to \"take on a more active leadership role\" in nuclear forensics. The $40 million in funding for NTNF was moved from the DNN R&D Nuclear Detonation Detection subprogram. As in past years, the FY2020 appropriations included a provision prohibiting funds in the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account for certain activities and assistance in the Russian Federation. Appropriations bills have prohibited this since FY2015. The FY2021 budget justification requests funds related to the U.S. plutonium disposition program in the M3 Material Disposition subprogram and Nonproliferation Construction Surplus Plutonium Disposition subprogram. The United States pledged to dispose of 34 metric tons of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium, which was originally to be converted into fuel for commercial power reactors. The U.S. facility for this purpose was to be the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF), which had been under construction at the DOE Savannah River site in South Carolina. The MFFF faced sharply escalating construction and operation cost estimates, and the Obama Administration proposed to terminate it in FY2017. After congressional approval, in 2018 DOE ended MFFF construction and began pursuing a replacement disposal method, Dilute and Dispose (D&D), for this material . The D&D method consists of \"blending plutonium with an inert mixture, packaging it for safe storage and transport, and disposing of it in a geologic repository,\" according to the FY2021 request. The Nonproliferation Construction account's proposed decrease of $150 million in FY2021 is due to the final steps in ending construction of the MFFF. In her testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, NNSA Administrator Lisa Gordon-Hagerty said that decrease reflects the completion of the MOX contractual termination settlement. She said that the requested $148.6 million would be used for the Surplus Plutonium Disposition (SPD) project, in support of the D&D method. FY2021 activities would include \"execution of early site preparation and long lead procurements activities, as well as continuing the maturation of the design for all major systems supporting the plutonium processing gloveboxes.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nThe Department of Energy's (DOE's) nonproliferation and national security programs provide technical capabilities to support U.S. efforts to \"prevent, counter, respond\" to the proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide, including by both states and non-state actors. These programs are administered by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi-autonomous agency established within DOE in 2000. NNSA is responsible for maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, providing nuclear fuel to the Navy, nuclear and radiological emergency response, and nonproliferation. NNSA recently reorganized the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, which is funded under the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) account. This report addresses the programs in the NNSA's DNN account, appropriated by the Energy and Water appropriations bill. The FY2020 Consolidated Appropriations bill ( P.L. 116-94) funded the NNSA DNN accounts at $2.164 billion. The FY2021 request for DNN appropriations was $2.031 billion. The proposal would include unobligated prior year balances. The reduction continues an earlier trend to reduce prior-year carryover balances. According to the budget justi fication, the decrease of 6.2% from the FY2020-enacted level is due to \"completion of funding for contractual termination\" of the mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) project at the Savannah River Site."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nVA provides or pays for long-term care—ranging from assistance with dressing and bathing to clinical care for spinal injuries or dementia— through three institutional and 11 noninstitutional programs. (See fig. 1 for a list of VA’s institutional and noninstitutional long-term care programs and app. I for brief descriptions of these programs.) VA’s long-term care programs serve over 500,000 veterans with a wide range of characteristics and needs. Further, certain Community Nursing Homes, Adult Day Health Care, and Hospice and Respite Care programs have specially trained staff to serve veterans with dementia, and the Spinal Cord Injury and Disability Home Care program and certain VA Community Living Centers are equipped to serve veterans needing ventilator care. All veterans enrolled in the VA health care system are eligible for VA’s basic medical benefits package, which includes coverage for certain institutional and noninstitutional long-term care services. A veteran’s eligibility for fully or partially covered nursing home care is determined by the veteran’s priority for care, which is generally based on the veteran’s service-connected disability status. VA must cover the full cost of nursing home care for veterans who need this care for a service-connected disability and for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 70 percent or more. Veterans’ placement into particular long-term care programs may depend on their clinical needs, disability ratings, preferences, and the availability of VA programs. When funds are limited, the agency may prioritize program placement based on veterans’ service- connected disability ratings. Decisions about which long-term care programs may be the best fit are made at the VA medical center (VAMC) level between VA providers, veterans, and their families. As we reported in February 2020, VA data shows that utilization of and spending for VA long-term care programs generally increased from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. Specifically, the number of veterans receiving care in VA’s long-term care programs increased 14 percent from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, from 464,071 to 530,327 veterans, while spending grew 33 percent from $6.8 billion to $9.1 billion. Further, we found that VA projects utilization and expenditures for long-term care to increase for most of the programs included in VA’s EHCPM from fiscal years 2017 through 2037. Specifically, over that time period VA’s model projects the following: Utilization of long-term care—in terms of various VA workload units— is projected to grow in one of the two institutional programs and nine of the 10 noninstitutional programs included in the EHCPM from fiscal years 2017 through 2037. Spending, which VA reports as expenditures, is projected to more than double from fiscal years 2017 through 2037, increasing from $6.9 billion to $14.3 billion. (See fig. 2.) VA also projects that the proportion of expenditures for institutional long-term care will decrease from 63 percent to 53 percent while the proportion of noninstitutional program expenditures is projected to grow from 37 percent to 47 percent in that same time period. According to VA officials, these projected increases are due to a variety of factors, including that VA plans to continue expanding the availability of noninstitutional care, and plans on providing care to an increasing number of aging veterans and veterans rated in the highest service- connected disability groups. Officials also noted that expanding veterans’ access to noninstitutional care programs is less costly than institutional care, and veterans prefer to delay or reduce the amount of institutional care they receive. VA’s strategies to meet the growing demand for long- term care are operationalized by GEC at the program level and implemented at the regional and VAMC level. In our February 2020 report, we found that VA faces a number of key challenges in meeting veterans’ growing demand for long-term care: workforce shortages, geographic alignment of care, and difficulty meeting veterans’ needs for specialty care. While GEC recognizes and has taken some steps to address the challenges it faces, it has not established measurable goals for its efforts to address these three key challenges: GEC has not established measurable goals to address workforce shortages, such as staffing targets to address the waitlist for the Home-Based Primary Care program. GEC has not established measurable goals for its efforts to address the geographic alignment of care, such as specific targets for providing long-term care within the Home Telehealth and Veteran Directed Care programs. GEC has not established measurable goals for its efforts to address difficulties meeting veterans’ needs for specialty care, such as specific targets for the number of available ventilators or the number of caregivers educated to help veterans with dementia. As we noted in our report, without measurable goals, VA is limited in its ability to better plan for and understand progress towards addressing the challenges it faces meeting veterans’ long-term care needs. To address this issue, we recommended that GEC develop measurable goals for its efforts to address these key long-term care challenges. VA concurred with this recommendation. In our February 2020 report we also found that VA had identified, but had not planned to take steps to fully address, challenges at the VAMC level that affect VA’s ability to meet veterans’ long-term care needs: VA identified that VAMCs do not have a consistent approach to managing VA’s 14 long-term care programs. At VAMCs where there are not GEC staff, long-term care programs could be run by one or more departments within the VAMC, for example the Nursing department or the Social Work department. GEC officials told us that this fragmentation hinders standardization and the ability to get veterans the appropriate care. VA also identified that VAMCs use different approaches to assess the amount of noninstitutional long-term care services veterans need. While GEC has developed a tool to improve the consistency in these determinations, VA has not required the tool be used in all VAMCs, as of October 2019. As a result, decisions about the amount of services veterans receive may vary by VAMC. To address these issues, we recommended that GEC leadership set time frames for and implement (1) a consistent GEC structure at the VAMC level and (2) VAMC-wide standardization of the tool for assessing noninstitutional program needs of veterans. VA concurred with our recommendations. Chairwoman Brownley, Ranking Member Dunn, and Members of the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.

From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, VA data show that the number of veterans receiving long-term care in these programs increased 14 percent (from 464,071 to 530,327 veterans), and obligations for the programs increased 33 percent (from $6.8 to $9.1 billion). VA projects demand for long-term care will continue to increase, driven in part by growing numbers of aging veterans and veterans with service-connected disabilities. Expenditures for long-term care are projected to double by 2037, as shown below. According to VA officials, VA plans to expand veterans' access to noninstitutional programs, when appropriate, to prevent or delay nursing home care and to reduce costs. VA currently faces three key challenges meeting the growing demand for long-term care: workforce shortages, geographic alignment of care (particularly for veterans in rural areas), and difficulty meeting veterans' needs for specialty care. VA's Geriatrics and Extended Care office (GEC) recognizes these challenges and has developed some plans to address them. However, GEC has not established measurable goals for these efforts, such as specific staffing targets for programs with waitlists or specific targets for providing telehealth to veterans in rural areas. Without measurable goals, VA is limited in its ability to address the challenges it faces meeting veterans' long-term care needs."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), most recently comprehensively amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ), is the primary source of federal aid to elementary and secondary education. Title I-A is the largest program in the ESEA, funded at $15.9 billion for FY2019. Title I-A is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending elementary and secondary schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) determines Title I-A grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on four separate funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). This report provides FY2019 state grant amounts under each of the four formulas used to determine Title I-A grants. For a general overview of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44164, ESEA Title I-A Formulas: In Brief . For a more detailed discussion of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44461, Allocation of Funds Under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act . Under Title I-A, funds are allocated to LEAs via state educational agencies (SEAs) using the four Title I-A formulas. Annual appropriations acts specify portions of each year's Title I-A appropriation to be allocated to LEAs and states under each of the formulas. In FY2019, about 41% of Title I-A appropriations were allocated through the Basic Grants formula, 9% through the Concentration Grants formula, and 25% each through the Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas. Once funds reach LEAs, the amounts allocated under the four formulas are combined and used jointly. For each formula, a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a \"formula child count,\" consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children living in families in poverty, by an \"expenditure factor\" based on state average per pupil expenditures for public elementary and secondary education. In some of the Title I-A formulas, additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor to determine a maximum grant amount. These maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula, taking into account a variety of state and LEA minimum grant provisions. In general, LEAs must have a minimum number of formula children and/or a minimum formula child rate to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific Title I-A formula. Some LEAs may qualify for a grant under only one formula, while other LEAs may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas. Under three of the formulasâBasic, Concentration, and Targeted Grantsâgrants are initially calculated at the LEA level. State grants are the total of allocations for all LEAs in the state, adjusted for state minimum grant provisions. Under EFIG, grants are first calculated for each state overall and then are subsequently suballocated to LEAs within the state using a different formula. FY2019 grants included in this report were calculated by ED. The percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas was calculated by CRS for each state by dividing the total grant received by the total amount allocated under each respective formula. Table 1 provides each state's grant amount and percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas for FY2019. Total Title I-A grants, calculated by summing the state level grant for each of the four formulas, are also shown in Table 1 . Overall, California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount ($2.0 billion) and, as a result, the largest percentage share (12.52%) of Title I-A grants. Vermont received the smallest total Title I-A grant amount ($36.9 million) and, as a result, the smallest percentage share (0.24%) of Title I-A grants. In general, grant amounts for states vary among formulas due to the different allocation amounts for the formulas. For example, the Basic Grant formula receives a greater share of overall Title I-A appropriations than the Concentration Grant formula, so states generally receive higher grant amounts under the Basic Grant formula than under the Concentration Grant formula. Among states, Title I-A grant amounts and the percentage shares of funds vary due to the different characteristics of each state. For example, Texas has a larger population of children included in the formula calculations than North Carolina and, therefore, is to receive a higher grant amount and larger share of Title I-A funds. Within a state, the percentage share of funds allocated may vary by formula, as certain formulas are more favorable to certain types of states (e.g., EFIG is generally more favorable to states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their LEAs). If a state's share of a given Title I-A formula exceeds its share of overall Title I-A funds, this is generally an indication that this particular formula is more favorable to the state than formulas for which the state's share of funds is below its overall share of Title I-A funds. For example, Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming each received a higher percentage share of Targeted Grants than of overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Targeted Grant formula is more favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be. In states that received a minimum grant under all four formulas (Montana, North Dakota, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming), the shares under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas are greater than under the Basic Grant or Concentration Grant formulas, due to higher state minimums under these formulas. If a state received the minimum grant under a given Title I-A formula, the grant amount is denoted with an asterisk (*) in Table 1 .

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThis report compiles the final congressional votes on free trade agreements (FTAs), trade promotion authority (TPA), and U.S membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO). In the past 30 years, the United States has pursued bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements in an attempt to liberalize markets and reduce trade and investment barriers. Congress has played a central role in shaping this trade policy. Congressâthrough debate and legislationâdefines trade negotiation priorities, approves FTAs, and helps oversee agreements' implementation and enforcement. While the President has the authority to negotiate treaties with foreign countries, Congress has sole constitutional authority to regulate international trade. Since 1934, Congress has periodically delegated some authority to negotiate trade agreements to the President. In the Trade Act of 1974, Congress outlined many of the congressional and executive roles regarding trade agreements; Congress delegated negotiation authority to the President, but required congressional approval (through implementation legislation) of free trade agreements. Congress also created a process to allow for expedient consideration in Congress of FTAs, provided that the President observe certain statutory requirements. This expedient consideration is known as TPA or, formerly, \"fast-track\" consideration. The United States is currently party to 12 bilateral FTAs (with Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Jordan, South Korea, Morocco, Oman, Panama, Peru, and Singapore) and to 2 regional free trade agreements (the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR)). The United States has also signed an agreement with Canada and Mexico to replace NAFTA. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has been ratified by all three parties, and the agreement will enter into force, after the necessary legal and regulatory measures are in place for each party to meet its commitments. For a list and timeline of trade agreements where negotiations were concluded, see Table 1 . For a compilation of final congressional votes on FTAs considered in Congress, see Table 2 . In addition to bilateral and regional FTAs, the United States is also party to multilateral agreements that outline membership in the WTO, a 164-member international organization. The WTO was created in 1995 to oversee and administer multilateral trade rules, serve as a forum for trade liberalization negotiations, and resolve trade disputes. When Congress approved the WTO Uruguay Round Agreement, it included a set of procedures to allow Congress to reconsider U.S. membership in the WTO by passing a joint resolution calling for withdrawal from the organization. Congress may vote every five years on withdrawal from the WTO. Resolutions were introduced in the 106 th and 109 th Congress; neither passed. See Table 3 for a compilation of major legislation and votes concerning U.S. membership to the WTO. All U.S. FTAs, except the agreement with Jordan, were considered in Congress under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). TPA is the process by which Congress enables FTA legislation to be considered under expedited legislative procedures, provided the President observes certain statutory obligations. Because TPA is extended only for limited periods, Congress periodically reconsiders legislation to extend it and to outline future negotiation objectives. Since 1974, Congress has passed seven measures extending TPA. TPA, like many issues related to international trade, has been politically contentious in Congress over time, resulting in vigorous debate and two multi-year lapses in authority. For a list of major votes on TPA, see Table 4 . Congressional consideration of bills can be a complex process, sometimes requiring multiple votes. For clarity's sake, this report only provides the final vote for each measure. More complete bill information can be found on Congress.govâincluding roll call votes for all legislation back to 1993. The bill numbers listed in the following tables link to Congress.gov, and the vote tallies link to the House and Senate roll call votes, for all votes back to 1993. Table 1 provides a timeline of trade agreements including the date the agreement was signed, the date implementing legislation was enacted, and the date the agreement went into force. The table also notes the TPA legislation under which the trade agreement was considered in Congress. The table includes fully implemented trade agreements, as well as two recent agreements: the USMCA, which has not yet entered into force, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that the United States signed, but later announced that it would not ratify. Table 2 provides major votes on FTAs, including the final House and Senate votes on FTA implementing legislation. Table 3 provides major votes on U.S. membership to the WTO, including implementing legislation for multilateral agreements and resolutions calling for the United States to withdraw from the WTO. Table 4 provides major votes on TPA legislation. It includes the final House and Senate votes on TPA-related provisions. Votes are grouped by the trade agreement authority granted to the President.

This authority requires congressional approval (through implementation legislation) of comprehensive FTAs. Since 1979, Congress has passed 17 implementation measures for FTAs and multilateral trade agreements. The majority of these trade agreementsâincluding the recent United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) â were considered in Congress under TPA, which provides for expedited consideration of FTAs in Congress. Since 1979, Congress has passed six measures extending TPA for limited time periods. As with many international trade issues, TPA has been politically contentious over time, resulting in vigorous debate and two multi-year lapses in authority. USMCA is the most recent free trade agreement (FTA) to be approved by Congress under TPA."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nC ongressional employees are retained to perform public duties that include assisting Members in official responsibilities in personal, committee, leadership, or administrative office settings. The roles, duties, and activities of congressional staff are matters of ongoing interest to Members of Congress, congressional staff, groups, and individuals, including those who raise concerns about congressional operations. Most observers recognize that Congress does not function without staff, but there is little systematic attention to what staff do, or what Members expect of them. In congressional offices, there may be interest in identifying Member expectations of congressional staff duties by position from multiple perspectives, including assessment of staffing needs in Member offices; guidance in setting position expectations, qualifications, and experience when offices choose to hire staff; and informing current and potential congressional employees of position expectations. Members of the House and Senate generally establish their own employment policies and practices for their personal offices. It is arguably the case that within Member offices, a common group of activities is executed for which staff with relevant skillsets and other qualifications are necessary. A body of publicly available job advertisements for staff positions from a number of different offices can shed light on the expectations Members have for position duties, as well as staff skills, characteristics, experience, and other expectations. For 33 commonly used congressional staff position titles, this report describes the most frequently listed job duties, applicant skills, characteristics, prior experiences, and other expectations found in a sample of job advertisements placed by Members of Congress between approximately December 2014 and September 2019 seeking staff in their offices. Table 1 lists the position titles and the frequency with which advertisements for them appeared in the sample. Data used in developing sample position expectations were taken from several publicly available sources, including the following, over the periods specified: The House Employment Bulletin, published weekly by the House Vacancy Announcement and Placement Service (HVAPS) in the Human Resources Office of the House Chief Administrative Officer (CAO). Data were collected from ads published between approximately January 2015 and September 2019. The Employment Bulletin, published online by the Senate \"as a service to Senate offices choosing to advertise staff vacancies.\" Data were collected from ads, which were not dated, appearing from approximately July 2016 to July 2019. The House GOP Job and Resume Bank, which posts ads on behalf of the House Republican Conference on Facebook. Ads were collected between approximately January and June 2017. Other ads were collected from the period between approximately December 2014 and January 2017 from the House GOP Job Bank web page on the website of Representative Virginia Foxx during part of her tenure as the House Republican Conference Secretary. The Job Announcements Board hosted by Representative Steny Hoyer during part of his tenure as House Minority Whip. Data were collected from ads posted between approximately January 2016 and December 2017. More than 1,800 ads were collected from all sources. Duplicate ads resulting from posts to more than one source, and ads that appear to have been frequently reposted, were removed, as were ads for positions in congressional settings other than personal offices, yielding 880 ads for positions in Member personal offices. Substantially similar position titles (e.g., deputy scheduler and state deputy scheduler) for which there were five or more ads were identified and grouped together, as were related job titles (e.g., positions designated as district, field, or regional representative that had essentially similar job duties and expectations) for which there were five or more substantially similar ads, yielding a total of 704 ads. Ads for the 33 identified position titles were further categorized if there were five or more ads that specified the advertised position as \"not entry level\" or other signifier of presumptive advanced status. The 704 ads were coded against a variety of variables within eight categories, including ad tracking information; ad details; position responsibilities and responsibility areas; expected job skills, qualifications, and credentials; application materials; and office type. The distribution of ads by job title and level is provided in Table 1 . Solicitations of applicants for congressional staff appear to originate in a highly decentralized manner. Means of identifying appropriate candidates might potentially include reassigning staff within offices, placing ads in services that make them available by subscription, word of mouth, and other nonpublic means of identifying potential applicants for congressional staff positions. Consequently, it cannot be determined whether the dataset of ads analyzed in this report is representative of all congressional employment solicitations. In addition, the process by which candidates for some Member office senior staff positions are identified may not be public-facing. Based on information specified within the ads, most position titles were identified by one of the following four primary responsibility areas (some positions were identified by up to three responsibility areas): Legislative, Policy, and Oversight, Media, Messaging, and Speeches, Constituent Communications, Outreach, and Service, and Office Administration and Support. For each position, at least one sample position description was created based on the coded data. Information includes the most frequently occurring of the following: primary responsibility areas; widely expected duties, typically up to six of the most frequently occurring duties specified in all ads for that position; other potential duties, typically up to six other duties mentioned in more than one ad; applicant information, including characteristics, skills, and knowledge and prior experience; and other expectations. Categorizing congressional staff positions by position title relies on an assumption that similarly titled positions in House and Senate personal offices carry out the same tasks under essentially similar circumstances. While personal offices may carry out similar activities, the assumption might be questionable given the differences in staff resources in House and Senate offices, as well as potential differences within offices of each chamber. Generalizations about staff roles and duties may also be limited in some ways due to the broad discretion Members have with regard to running their office activities. Variations from office to office, which might include differences in job duties, work schedules, office emphases, and other factors, may limit the extent to which sample position expectations provided here match operational practices in all congressional offices.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe roles, duties, and activities of congressional staff are matters of ongoing interest to Members of Congress, congressional staff, and observers of Congress.
