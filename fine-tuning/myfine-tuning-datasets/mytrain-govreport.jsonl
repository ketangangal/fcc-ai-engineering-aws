With the unemployment rate at 9.8% in November 2010, those still employed or able to find jobs are quite likely to know personally others who have been less fortunate. The still high unemployment rate partly reflects the slow pace at which employers have been adding workers to their payrolls despite enactment of job creation legislation in February 2009 (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, P.L. 111-5 ), March 2010 (the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, P.L. 111-147 ), and August 2010 (the Education Jobs Fund at Title I of the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act, P.L. 111-226 ). This report addresses the question of when one might reasonably expect to see sustained improvement in the unemployment rate and a steady resumption of job growth following a recession's end. It first provides an explanation of why it is unlikely that the unemployment rate would begin trending downward and the number of jobs on employer payroll would begin trending upward immediately after the start of a recovery. It then analyzes the trend in the unemployment rate and jobs data before and after the bottom of the prior 10 business cycles to confirm these statements. A few definitions are called for before proceeding with the explanation. To begin with, the official definition of the unemployment rate prescribed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the percentage of persons in the civilian labor force age 16 and older who are unemployed. The labor force, in turn, is defined as the number of employed and unemployed individuals in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and older. Lastly, unemployment is defined as the number of people who actively searched for work in the four weeks before the week in which the Census Bureau administers the Current Population Survey to members of households. Mathematically, the unemployment rate is expressed as: The unemployment rate consequently may move up or down depending not just on a change in the number of workers who lack jobs (the numerator) but also on a change in the number of individuals participating in the labor force (the denominator). The size of the labor force may decrease during a recession in part because unemployed workers who give up searching for jobs out of discouragement over their reemployment prospects cease to be included. Conversely, the number of labor force participants may increase during a recession if people see signs the economy is improving and think it again worthwhile to look for work. If hiring does not keep pace with discouraged workers reentering the labor force, for example, the unemployment rate will rise in the face of otherwise good economic news. The unemployment rate thus is called a lagging economic indicator: it typically improves only after other indicators have signaled an impending recovery and actually may rise for some time after a recession's end. Firms usually are reluctant to add workers to their payrolls until convinced that the economy will continue growing (i.e., gross domestic product, GDP, will keep increasing). Before employers are fairly certain that the increase in demand for their goods and services will continue, they are likely to boost production by restoring the hours of those currently in their employ and by having employees work overtime rather than by hiring new workers or recalling laid off workers. As a result, job growth may not occur immediately upon the economy showing signs of a turnaround. The source of jobs data that labor market analysts generally utilize is the Current Employment Statistics program. In its establishment survey, BLS queries nonfarm employers each month about the number of jobs (employees) on their payrolls. Employers are considered to be a more accurate source for this information compared to the members of households who respond to the Current Population Survey, from which the unemployment rate and most demographic information on workers is derived. In addition, the Business Cycle Dating Committee appears to rely chiefly on changes in both national output (GDP) and employment trends from the establishment survey to determine the official beginning and end of recessions. The U.S. economy experienced 10 recessions since World War II, excluding the latest, which ran from December 2007 to June 2009. These recessions varied greatly in severity, as measured by the extent of decline in GDP, and their duration. But, without exception, the unemployment rate kept increasing until or more often after each recession had ended. (See Table 1 .) The unemployment rate peaked at the bottom of the business cycle in three instances: at 7.9% in October 1949, at 7.8% in July 1980, and at 10.8% in November 1982. In the remaining seven recessions, the unemployment rate did not peak until after they had ended. Four times the unemployment rate kept climbing for only a few months into the economic recovery: four months after the July 1953-May 1954 recession ended, three months after the August 1957-April 1958 recession and the April 1960-February 1961 recession ended, and two months after the November 1973-March 1975 recession ended. In contrast, the unemployment rate did not peak until well into the economic recovery in three instances. The unemployment rate kept rising for nine months after the end of the December 1969-November 1970 recession, 15 months after the end of the July 1990-March 1991 recession, and 18 months after the end of the March-November 2001 recession. Like the unemployment rate, the employment data generally fit the picture of no steady job growth until some months after a recession's end. As shown in Figure 1 , a sustained period of job growth failed to ensue until after the end of all 10 recessions. In only one of those instances—the very short January-July 1980 recession—did the employment level immediately begin trending upward. In the other nine cases, the number of jobs on employer payrolls fluctuated for months after the recession's end. Sustained job growth occurred within three to five months of the start of seven recoveries. In sharp contrast, steady job growth did not commence until March 1992—12 months after the July 1990-March 1991 recession ended; and not until September 2003—22 months after the March-November 2001 recession ended. The very delayed improvement in the labor market following the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions led to the ensuing rebounds of the economy being referred to as jobless recoveries. With employment at public and private sector employers similarly having failed to show consistent improvement for well over a year since the recession's end, many observers think the nation has been experiencing another jobless recovery. While employment at firms in the private sector of the economy started to steadily rise in January 2010, it appears that the fiscal problems of local governments in particular have dampened the pace of overall job growth.", "completion": "response:\nAlthough the 11th recession of the postwar period officially ended in June 2009, one economic indicator that is very visible in people's daily lives—the unemployment rate—has continued to rise.

The resolution is based in part on committee requests for funds to cover their necessary expenses for the two years of a Congress. The budgetary requests include estimated salary needs for staff, costs of consulting services, printing costs, office equipment and supply costs, and travel costs for committee members and staff. Some costs, such as pension and insurance contributions for committee employees, are paid from other appropriated funds, and are excluded from committee budgets. Some committees discuss and approve their proposed budgets at committee organization meetings. Committee chairs normally introduce House resolutions to provide their committees with the requisite funds for the two years of the Congress. These individual resolutions are then referred to the Committee on House Administration, which may hold a public hearing on the committee's request. The chair and the ranking minority member from each committee typically testify at these hearings. The chair of CHA then typically introduces an omnibus funding resolution, which, after its referral to the CHA, typically serves as the legislative vehicle for a full committee markup.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nNonprofit organizations that meet the criteria in Internal Revenue Code Â§ 501(c)(3) qualify to be exempt from the federal income tax. The organization may be formed as a corporation, trust, or unincorporated association. Organizations are formed under state law, and the specific requirements vary by state. In general, a state's secretary of state will be able to provide information on how to form an organization. In order to be eligible for tax-exempt status, the organization must meet the requirements in IRC Â§ 501(c)(3). Section 501(c)(3) reads: Corporations, and any community chest, fund, or foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or to foster national or international amateur sports competition (but only if no part of its activities involve the provision of athletic facilities or equipment), or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation (except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)) , and which does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office. Thus, there are basically four requirements: The organization must be operated and organized for at least one of the listed exempt purposes. This means that no more than an insubstantial amount of the organization's activities may be for nonexempt purposes, and the organization must serve a public, as opposed to private, interest. The organization's earnings may not be used to benefit any person having a personal and private interest in the organization's activities. No more than an insubstantial amount of the organization's activities may be lobbying. The organization may not participate in any political campaign activity. Organizations that meet these qualifications must generally apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for recognition of their Â§ 501(c)(3) status. Some religious organizations, such as churches, do not have to seek recognition from the IRS of their tax-exempt status. Additionally, organizations, other than private foundations, with normally no more than $5,000 in annual gross receipts do not have to apply for recognition. An organization should try to file the application soon after its formation. If the application is filed within 27 months of the organization's formation, the exemption will generally be effective back to the date of formation. The IRS may grant an extension depending on the circumstances. If the organization does not file its application in a timely manner, it will generally not be treated as an exempt organization for the period between its formation and the postmark date on the application. An organization seeking Â§ 501(c)(3) status must file an application (Form 1023) that shows it meets the organizational and operational requirements. The application asks questions concerning a variety of areas related to the organization's activities. The organization's operations must be described and organizing documents, such as articles of incorporation or association, must be included. There are detailed questions about the compensation of and dealings with directors and highly-compensated employees, and the organization must complete financial statements. Additionally, the application must include the organization's Employer Identification Number (EIN), which may be obtained online or by telephone, and, if applicable, a power of attorney authorization, among other documents. The IRS may require additional information. As part of the application, organizations must pay a user fee. The fee is $300 for organizations with average annual gross receipts of not more than $10,000 and $750 for all other organizations. A new organization should use its expected average receipts to determine which fee is appropriate. On the application, the organization will need to tell the IRS that it is either a public charity or a private foundation. In general, private foundations receive contributions from limited sources and do not directly provide charitable services. Due to fear of abuse, private foundations are subject to stricter regulation than public charities. An organization is a private foundation unless it shows the IRS that it meets the requirements to be a public charity. Some organizations, such as churches, schools, and hospitals, automatically qualify to be public charities. Other organizations will be classified as public charities if they can show the IRS that they receive substantial public support. An advance ruling allows a new organization to be treated as a public charity even though it is unable to show the IRS that it receives sufficient public support. The intent is to allow an organization to have five years in which to develop operations to obtain the necessary level of support. An organization can request an advance ruling on Form 1023. The organization should be able to show that it reasonably expects to be publicly supported during the advance ruling period. If the IRS grants the request, the organization will be treated as a public charity for five years and then must prove to the IRS that it receives substantial public support for the treatment to continue. Applications are sent to IRS Exempt Organization (EO) Determinations. EO Determinations determines whether the organization meets the exemption requirements by looking at the statutory language, IRS regulations, and such sources as IRS revenue rulings. EO Determinations may ask an organization for further information. Difficult cases, e.g., where there is no precedent or technical advice is needed, are referred to IRS Headquarters. An organization may request a referral to this office for an issue requiring technical advice. If the IRS approves the application, a favorable determination letter is sent to the organization. As discussed above, if the application for Â§ 501(c)(3) status was filed in a timely manner, the exemption will generally be effective back to the date of the organization's formation. The exemption will not be effective back to formation if the IRS requires the organization to make changes in its structure or operations in order to receive the exemption or if the application was not timely filed. In both cases, the effective date of the exemption will be provided in the determination letter. Once the exemption has been approved, the organization may generally continue to rely on its Â§ 501(c)(3) status unless there is a material change in the organization's purpose or activities that is inconsistent with the exemption requirements. Additionally, events outside of the organization's control may affect its status, including new laws, treaties, court decisions, or regulations. If the IRS issues an adverse determination, then the organization may protest the decision to the IRS Appeals Office or, if appropriate, IRS Headquarters. Once the organization has exhausted its administrative appeals, it may, subject to numerous requirements, file an appeal in the federal courts. The IRS expects to respond to an exemption application within four months of the application's receipt. In 2002, the IRS estimated the average review was 91 days. A common reason for delays is that the organization's application has incomplete information. The IRS has internal procedures that allow for expedited review of an application when: an organization has a pending grant and the failure to secure the grant may have an adverse impact on the organization's ability to continue operations, an organization is intended to provide relief to disaster victims, the determination process was delayed due to the fault of the IRS, or EO Determinations management determines that expedited review is warranted for a situation not listed above. An organization must request expedited review in its application. The management at EO Determinations decides whether the application will be given priority treatment. An example of the IRS using an expedited review procedure occurred after September 11, 2001. On September 18, 2001, the IRS announced it would give priority treatment to applications of charities formed to respond to the events of September 11. The IRS estimated that the average review of these applications was seven days. The IRS also used the expedited review procedure after Hurricane Katrina for organizations seeking Â§ 501(c)(3) status to provide relief to the victims.", "completion": "response:\nCharities and other entities seeking tax-exempt status as Â§ 501(c)(3) organizations generally must apply to the Internal Revenue Service.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nMembers of Congress have demonstrated an ongoing interest in annual U.S. contributions to the United Nations (U.N.) regular budget, which funds core activities for U.N. organs such as the General Assembly and Security Council, staffing and administration at U.N. headquarters, international conferences, human rights promotion, and U.N. special political missions, among other things. Over the years, Congress has focused on the overall cost of the U.S. assessment to the regular budget per year, as well as any outstanding contributions; how the United States assessment compares to the assessments of other U.N. member states; and how the United States' payment of its assessed contributions over time compares with other U.N. member states. In 2010—the last calendar year for which data are publicly available—the United States was the single largest contributor to the regular budget, paying $532,435,102, or 22%, in assessed contributions. The next largest contributors were Japan (12.530%), Germany (8.018%), the United Kingdom (6.604%), and France (6.123%). Seventeen countries, including the United States, were assessed at over 1%, representing about 83% of the total regular budget. Ten countries were assessed between 0.5% and 1%, accounting for about 7% of the budget. The rest of the U.N. membership (167 countries) accounted for about 8% of the regular budget. This report highlights, for each of the past 20 years, payments and the total outstanding contributions of the top contributors to the U.N. regular budget—including the United States. For additional information on U.S. funding of the U.N. system, see CRS Report RL33611, United Nations System Funding: Congressional Issues , by [author name scrubbed]. The enclosed tables list the assessment level, actual payment, and contributions outstanding of key contributors to the U.N. regular budget from calendar years 1990 through 2010. Most countries pay their assessment in full during the calendar year. Other countries, however, (including Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine, USSR/Russian Federation, and the United States) have on occasion failed to pay the entire assessment and maintained unpaid or outstanding contribution balances. Consequently, the annual payments listed may not always match the assessment for any given year. Each table is divided into four columns, described below. Countries —Contributing countries are grouped into key categories: (1) the \"United States\"; (2) \"Other Major Contributors,\" which are countries assessed at more than 1%; (3) \"Middle Contributors,\" a new category created in 2004 that provides data on nations that are assessed at 0.5% and over but less than 1%; and (4) \"Rest of Membership,\" which lists overall contributions from the remaining member states. Assessment —The percentage of the U.N. regular budget at which a country is assessed. Payment —Country payments to the U.N. regular budget that have been received and duly recorded as of December 31 of each calendar year (assessed contributions received after that date are reported in the next statement on the status of contributions). Contributions Outstanding —Total outstanding contributions represent money owed by a country as of December 31 of that year. It includes both current year and prior year contributions outstanding. Four of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members are identified in each table, and information on the fifth permanent Council member, China, is provided in a footnote.

In some instances, the President makes these appointments using authorities granted to the President alone. Other appointments, generally referred to with the abbreviation PAS, are made by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate via the nomination and confirmation process. This report identifies, for the 112 th Congress, all nominations submitted to the Senate for executive-level full-time positions in the 15 executive departments for which the Senate provides advice and consent. It excludes appointments to regulatory boards and commissions as well as to independent and other agencies. This report features a pair of tables presenting information for each of these 15 executive departments. The first table in each pair provides information on full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation as of the end of the 112 th Congress and the pay levels of those positions. The second table for each department tracks appointment activity within the 112 th Congress by the Senate (confirmations, rejections, returns to the President, and elapsed time between nomination and confirmation) as well as further related presidential activity (including withdrawals and recess appointments). In some instances, no appointment action occurred within an agency during the 112 th Congress. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) http://www.lis.gov/nomis/ , the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents , telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code , and the 2012 Plum Book ( United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions ). Related Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports regarding the presidential appointments process, nomination activity for other executive branch positions, recess appointments, and other appointments-related matters may be found at http://www.crs.gov . Table 1 summarizes appointment activity, during the 112 th Congress, related to full-time PAS positions in the 15 executive departments. President Barack H. Obama submitted 116 nominations to the Senate for full-time positions to executive departments. Of these 116 nominations, 90 were confirmed; 11 were withdrawn; and 15 were returned to the President under the provisions of Senate rules. The length of time a given nomination may be pending in the Senate has varied widely. Some nominations were confirmed within a few days, others were confirmed within several months, and some were never confirmed. This report provides, for each executive department nomination confirmed in the 112 th Congress, the number of days between nomination and confirmation (\"days to confirm\"). For confirmed nominations, a mean of 151.4 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 131.5. Each of the 15 executive department profiles provided in this report is divided into two parts: a table listing the organization's full-time PAS positions as of the end of the 112 th Congress and a table listing appointment action for vacant positions during the 112 th Congress. Data for these tables were collected from several authoritative sources. In each department profile, the first of these two tables identifies, as of the end of the 112 th Congress, each full-time PAS position in that department and its pay level. For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, the pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule. As of January 2013, these pay levels ranged from level I ($199,700) for Cabinet-level offices to level V ($145,700) for lower-ranked positions. The second table, the appointment action table, provides, in chronological order, information concerning each nomination. It shows the name of the nominee, position involved, date of nomination or appointment, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation. It also notes actions other than confirmation (e.g., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President). The appointment action tables with more than one nominee to a position also list statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. Each appointment action table provides the average days to confirm in two ways: mean and median. Although the mean is a more familiar measure, it may be influenced by outliers in the data. The median, by contrast, does not tend to be influenced by outliers. In other words, a nomination that took an extraordinarily long time might cause a significant change in the mean, but the median would be unaffected. Examining both numbers offers more information with which to assess the central tendency of the data. For a small number of positions within a department, the two tables may contain slightly different titles for the same position. This is a result of the fact that the title used in the nomination the White House submits to the Senate, the title of the position as established by statute, and the title of the position used by the department itself are not always identical. The first table listing incumbents at the end of the 112 th Congress uses data provided by the department itself. The second table listing nomination action within each department relies primarily upon the Senate nominations database of the LIS. This information is based upon the nomination sent to the Senate by the White House. Any inconsistency in position titles between the two tables is noted in the notes following each appointment table. Appendix A provides two tables. Table A-1 relists all appointment action identified in this report and is organized alphabetically by the appointee's last name. Table entries identify the agency to which each individual was appointed, position title, nomination date, date confirmed or other final action, and duration count for confirmed nominations. The table also includes the mean and median values for the \"days to confirm\" column. Table A-2 provides summary data for each of the 15 executive departments identified in this report. The table summarizes the number of positions, nominations submitted, individual nominees, confirmations, nominations returned, and nominations withdrawn for each department. It also provides the mean and median values for the numbers of days taken to confirm nominations within each department. During the 112 th Congress, the Presidential Appointments Streamlining and Efficiency Act ( P.L. 112-166 ) was enacted, which eliminated the requirement for the Senate's advice and consent for 163 positions in federal agencies. A number of those positions, listed in Appendix B , have been included in previous versions of this tracking report. This report notes each agency and position affected.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe extended appropriations process for FY2011 began with the Obama Administration's FY2011 budget requested in February 2010 and culminated with the enactment of P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011. During that time, Congressional debate centered around two proposals, H.R. 1 , which was approved by the House on February 19, 2011, and S.Amdt. 149 , offered as a substitute proposal during Senate consideration of H.R. 1 . Although both proposals were rejected by the Senate on March 9, they were viewed by some as the starting point of final negotiations between House and Senate leaders that eventually led to the compromise embodied by P.L. 112-10 . Between the start of FY2011 on October 1, 2010, and the enactment of P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011, the federal government was funded through a series of resolutions continuing funding at FY2010 levels, with adjustments and exceptions. This report is intended to facilitate comparative analysis of the key proposals in the now completed FY2011 appropriations process. The report begins with a brief analysis of how each proposal could be expected to impact the federal budget deficit, which was a consideration of great importance to many lawmakers. This is followed by a table depicting discretionary funding levels provided in each of the three proposals by appropriations subcommittee and bill title, and comparing the FY2010 and FY2011 enacted appropriations. The table reflects the most recent estimates of FY2011 appropriations, which remain subject to change. This will be the final update of this report. A key issue in the FY2011 appropriations debate was the impact of discretionary federal spending on the nation's budget deficit. The budget deficit represents the level of spending, as measured by outlays, in excess of revenues. Appropriations acts, like those detailed in this report, provide budget authority. The outlays for a fiscal year result from the budget authority provided in that fiscal year as well as some budget authority provided in previous fiscal years. Included in the outlay level are all types of spending (i.e., emergency, non-emergency, overseas contingency operations) occurring during the fiscal year. Under the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) March 2011 baseline, the last CBO baseline estimate published prior to the enactment of P.L. 112-10 , the budget deficit for FY2011 was estimated at $1,399 billion. In that baseline, CBO assumes a full-year continuation of funding in FY2011 at roughly FY2010 levels. The proposals analyzed in this report provide annualized discretionary outlay levels as follows: FY2011 President's Budget (February 2010)—$1,415 billion CBO Baseline—$1,361 billion H.R. 1 —$1,356 billion S.Amdt. 149 —$1,372 billion P.L. 112-10 —$1,365 billion H.R. 1 , the proposal which proposed the greatest reduction to budget authority relative to current levels, would result in a discretionary outlay level that is $5 billion under the CBO March 2011 baseline level of discretionary outlays. This reduction in discretionary outlays comprises 0.4% of the deficit estimated under the CBO baseline. Savings from other proposals that would produce smaller reductions in discretionary outlays would correspondingly represent a smaller fraction of the CBO March 2011baseline deficit. The proposal that was ultimately enacted, P.L. 112-10 , is expected to result in a discretionary outlay level that is $4 billion above the CBO March 2011 baseline level of discretionary outlays. Some reductions in discretionary spending could also affect the level of mandatory or net interest spending or the amount of revenue collected, potentially impacting the ultimate deficit level for FY2011. For a more detailed look at the broad budgetary impact on FY2011 spending proposals, see CRS Report R41771, FY2011 Appropriations in Budgetary Context , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. The table below is intended to provide a sense of how funding for federal departments and agencies would be impacted by the different proposals, rather than the impact of each proposal on overall budget numbers. The data represent discretionary appropriations as provided in the respective proposals, by bill title. The final column compares the FY2010 and FY2011enacted funding levels. The title and bill totals do not include scorekeeping adjustments. Rescissions of prior year funding are noted as separate line items and are not deducted from the title totals.", "completion": "response:\nFY2011 funding levels were not enacted in the 111th Congress. Thus, the debate over FY2011 appropriations continued into the 112th Congress and FY2011 spending proposals became a key focal point in the budget debates between the now-Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Obama Administration. This report was originally intended to facilitate comparison of three key spending proposals for FY2011—the Administration's budget request, H.R. 1, and S.Amdt. 149 to H.R. 1—to FY2010 enacted funding levels.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nConcerns about the safety of Presidents have existed throughout the history of the Republic, beginning with George Washington in 1794, when he led troops against the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania. The intervening years have witnessed a variety of incidents of actual and potential harm to Presidents (as well as immediate family members and other high-ranking officials). These situations extend to illegal entries onto the White House grounds and the White House itself; violence and conflict near the President's residence or where he was visiting; unauthorized aircraft flying near the White House and, in one instance, a plane crashing into the building; schemes to use airplanes to attack the White House; other threats of attack, including bombings and armed assaults; feared kidnapping and hostage-taking; assassination plots; as well as immediate, direct assaults against Presidents. In addition to incumbents, Presidents-elect and candidates for the office have been subject to assaults or threats. This report identifies assassinations of and other direct assaults against Presidents, Presidents-elect, and candidates for the office of President. There have been 15 such attacks (against 14 individuals), with five resulting in death. The first incident occurred in 1835, involving President Andrew Jackson, when an attacker's pistol misfired. The most recent occurred in 2005, when a would-be assassin in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, tossed a grenade (which did not explode) at the platform where President George W. Bush and the Georgian President were speaking. The tally of victims reveals the following: Of the 43 individuals serving as President, 10 (or about 23%) have been subject to actual or attempted assassinations. Four of these 10 incumbents—Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy—were slain. Four of the seven most recent Presidents have been targets of assaults: Gerald R. Ford (twice in 1975), Ronald W. Reagan (in a near-fatal shooting in 1981), William J. Clinton (when the White House was fired upon in 1994), and George W. Bush (when an attacker tossed a grenade, which did not explode, towards him and the President of Georgia at a public gathering in Tbilisi in 2005). Two others who served as President were attacked, either as a President-elect (Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933) or as a presidential candidate (Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, when he was seeking the presidency after being out of office for nearly four years). Two other presidential candidates—Robert F. Kennedy, who was killed in 1968, and George C. Wallace, who was seriously wounded in 1972—were also victims, during the primaries. In only one of these 15 incidents (the Lincoln assassination) was a broad conspiracy proven, although such contentions have arisen on other occasions. Only one other incident involved more than one participant (the 1950 assault on Blair House, the temporary residence of President Harry S Truman); but no evidence of other conspirators emerged from the subsequent investigation or prosecution. Of the 15 direct assaults, 11 relied upon pistols, two on automatic weapons, one on a rifle, and one on a grenade. All but two of the attacks (both against Gerald Ford) were committed by men. All but one of the 15 assaults occurred within the United States. The following table identifies the direct assaults on Presidents, Presidents-elect, and candidates for the office of President. It specifies the date when the assault occurred, the victim, his political party affiliation, the length of his administration at the time of the attack or whether he was then a candidate or President-elect, the location of the attack, its method and result, and the name of the assailant, along with the professed or alleged reason for the attack (if known).", "completion": "response:\nDirect assaults against Presidents, Presidents-elect, and candidates have occurred on 15 separate occasions, with five resulting in death.

(3) Over four out offive graduates in the class of 1972 would have been first generation college students were they to have gone tocollegecompared to two out of three graduates in the class of 2000. (4) This decline of would be first generation college studentsroughly coincides with the growth in educational attainment that occurred during the same period. In 1970, 11%of theU.S. population were college graduates and by 2000 this had increased to 24%. (5) The proportion of high school graduates from families with income below 150% of the official poverty level has remainedrelatively stable at around 21% over the last 30 years, according to these data. Twenty percent of the class of 1972lived inlow-income families compared to 22% of the class of 2000. This parallels the rate of poverty for the U.S.population as awhole which has fluctuated between 16% and 20% over the same period. (6) Similar trends can be seen in the data on college students, although the Department has only begun to collect such datasince 1987. (7) These data indicate modest declinesin the proportion of low-income and first generation college students. The proportion of students from low-income families dropped from 16% to 12% between 1987 and 2000. Theproportionwho, upon graduation, would be the first in their family to get a college degree declined from 65% in 1987 to 62%in 2000. A second indication from these data is that the representation of first generation and low-income students among thoseenrolled in college has been consistently lower than among those graduating from high school. Thus, it appears thathighschool graduates from low-income families and those that lack a parent with a college degree are less likely thanothergraduates to move on to college. As stated above, the overall rate of college enrollment for the high school class of 2000 was 53%. That is, just over half ofthose who graduated in the spring of 2000 were enrolled in college in the fall of that year and just under half werenot. Theanalysis that follows reveals that the rate of enrollment is strongly related to parental educational attainment andfamilyincome. Table 1 shows fall 2000 college enrollment for the high school class of 2000 by parent's education. The rates ofenrollment for fall 2000 were 46% for those whose parents did not attain a Bachelor's degree and 75% for thosewhoseparents hold a Bachelor's degree. High school graduates whose parents lack a college degree were more than twiceaslikely not to be enrolled in college the fall after graduation as those whose parents have a college degree(54% compared to25%). Table 1. College Enrollment in the Fall of 2000 Among Spring 2000 High School Graduates by Parental Educational Attainment Source: Current Population Survey. Note: Columns may not sum to 100% due to rounding. Table 2 displays fall 2000 college enrollment for the high school class of 2000 by family income. The rates of enrollmentfor the fall of 2000 were 35% for those from families below 150% of the poverty line and 58% for those above150% ofpoverty. High school graduates from families below 150% of poverty were over 50% more likely not tobe enrolled incollege the fall after graduation as those from families above 150% of poverty (65% compared to 42%). Table 2. College Enrollment in the Fall of 2000 Among Spring 2000 High School Graduates by Family Income Source: Current Population Survey. Note: Columns may not sum to 100% due to rounding. The figures in Tables 1 and 2 also support the large body of research which has established a strong link between thesocio-economic status of parents (including income, occupation, and educational attainment) and that of theirchildren. Since the late 1960s, researchers have documented the various ways that \"class background is very important indetermining who goes to college.\" (8) Among theindicators of class background used in this research were direct measureslike family income and parent's education and more indirect measures like educational aspirations and collegepreparedness -- all have been found to be positively associated with college attendance and completion. The final section of this report takes a brief look at the combined effects of first generation status and family income onrates of college enrollment. Table 3 shows rates of college enrollment in the fall of 2000 amongthose who graduated highschool in the spring of 2000 by parental educational attainment and family income. Table 3 indicates that the rate of college enrollment among students from low-income families is not altered by parentaleducation -- 69% of those whose parents did not attain a Bachelor's degree were not enrolled, compared to 66% ofthosewhose parents have a Bachelor's degree (this difference is not statistically significant). Conversely, Table3 reveals thatparental educational attainment is strongly associated with college attendance among students above150% of poverty. Atthis income level, 51% of the graduates whose parents lack a Bachelor's degree went on to college compared to 75%of thegraduates whose parents have a Bachelor's degree. (9) Table 3. College Enrollment in the Fall of 2000 Among Spring 2000 High School Graduates by Parent's Educational Attainment and Family Income Status Source: Current Population Survey. Note: Columns may not sum to 100% due to rounding. The findings presented here indicate that rates of college enrollment vary greatly by family income and parental educational attainment. Rates of college enrollment among low-income and first generation students were muchlowerthan the overall rate for 2000 high school graduates. In the final analysis of the combined effects of these factors,firstgeneration status was found to have little association with the rate of enrollment of low-income students, but wasstronglyassociated with the rate of enrollment of students from families with greater income. These results have particularly important implications for the TRIO programs since the legislation stipulates that not lessthan two-thirds of program participants be both low-income and first generation students. The results which show that firstgeneration status does not impact upon the enrollment rate of low-income students might lead some to argue forremoval ofthe first generation portion of this requirement. However, since the findings do reveal lower college going ratesamongfirst generation students from higher income families, some might argue that the statute should be amended to read\"or\"rather than \"and.\" Another possibility would be an amendment to the definition of low-income to include studentsatgreater income levels whose enrollment likelihood is impacted by first generation status.", "completion": "response:\nThe Higher Education Act (HEA) supports several programs that provideservices and incentives to disadvantaged students to help increase their educational attainment.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates a number of disability-related telecommunications services, including video relay service (VRS). VRS is a form of telecommunications relay service (TRS). The service allows persons with hearing disabilities, using American Sign Language (ASL), to communicate with voice telephone users through video equipment rather than through typed text. Video equipment links the VRS user with a \"communications assistant\" (CA) so that the VRS user and the CA can see and communicate with each other in signed conversation (see Figure 1 ). VRS has quickly become a very popular service. It offers several features not available with the text-based TRS: People with hearing disabilities can communicate using ASL rather than typing what they want to say. This allows them to incorporate facial expressions and body language into their conversations, which cannot be done using text. A VRS call is more like a telephone conversation between two hearing persons. For example, the parties can interrupt each other. The parties cannot interrupt each other during a traditional TRS call because the parties have to take turns communicating with the CA. Conversation flows more naturally between the parties, so the conversation may take place more quickly than with TRS. VRS calls may be made between ASL users and hearing persons speaking either English or Spanish. VRS is different from other forms of TRS in two important ways: (1) the conversation between the VRS user and the CA is made through a video link and sign language rather than typed text; and (2) the service relies on the Internet, rather than the public telephone system, for the connection between the VRS user and the CA. Also, unlike some other forms of TRS, VRS is not mandatory. VRS is free to the caller, and VRS providers are reimbursed for their costs from the TRS Fund. Since July 1, 2011, the TRS Fund has been administered by Rolka Loube Saltzer Associates, LLC (RLSA). Prior to that date, the fund was administered by the National Exchange Carriers Association. VRS providers are subject to certain requirements and prohibitions: Eighty percent of all VRS calls must be answered within 120 seconds. Service must be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week. VRS providers must provide their users with a 10-digit telephone number, so users will be able to make 911 calls and have their location data routed to the appropriate emergency agency. Preferential treatment of calls is prohibited. VRS (and TRS) providers must handle calls in the order in which they are received. They cannot selectively answer calls from certain consumers or certain locations. Equipment distributed by a certified VRS provider must be interoperable with the technology of other certified VRS providers. VRS (and TRS) providers may not offer financial incentives to use their service or to make more or longer VRS (or TRS) calls. The VRS program is funded through the larger TRS Fund. The TRS Fund is a revolving fund financed through contributions by all providers of interstate telecommunications services. Contributions are based on a \"contribution factor\" that is set on an annual basis by the FCC. On June 29, 2018, the FCC set VRS rates for the 2018-2019 fund year (July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019) (see Table 1 ). For VRS providers with 500,000 or fewer monthly minutes, the per-minute VRS compensation rate is $5.29. Based on these compensation rates, the maximum rates within the range of VRS rates proposed by the Commission, projected demand for the services, and projected Fund administration expenses, the FCC adopted a funding requirement of $1,497,699,377, and a carrier contribution factor of 0.02801. The FCC has implemented changes to the VRS program to reduce fraud and abuse, better manage the amount of money that is collected to fund the program, and take advantage of technological advancements. The primary concern of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community appears to be that cuts to the fund may result in fewer and less-qualified ASL interpreters, which would decrease the functional equivalency of the service. Additionally, it is concerned that changes in technology—even \"better\" technology—will decrease competition among service providers, possibly decreasing innovation. Moreover, the community believes that changes in the technology could pose challenges to some users and make placing and receiving calls more difficult. The deaf and hard-of-hearing community will likely continue to contact Congress whenever changes are proposed for the VRS program. The community relies heavily on the program, so it is understandable that they might view any proposed changes with concern. However, the FCC also has a responsibility to make sure that the fund remains solvent and to take advantage of advances in technology that it has determined will improve the system. Congress may wish to monitor the current proposed changes to the system to ensure that the FCC, while working to modernize TRS technology and minimize financial abuse, also gives full consideration to the concerns of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.", "completion": "response:\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates a number of disability-related telecommunications services, including video relay service (VRS).

VRS has quickly become a very popular service, as it offers several features not available with the text-based telecommunications relay service (TRS). The FCC has adopted various rules to maintain the quality of VRS service. Now VRS providers must answer 80% of all VRS calls within 120 seconds. VRS providers must also offer the service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally, in June 2010, the FCC began a comprehensive review of the rates, structure, and practices of the VRS program to minimize waste, fraud, and abuse and update compensation rates that had become inflated above actual cost. Rules in that proceeding were issued in June 2013. The new rules initiated fundamental restructuring of the program to support innovation and competition, drive down ratepayer and provider costs, eliminate incentives for waste, and further protect consumers. In addition, the new rules transition VRS compensation rates toward actual costs over the next four years, initiating a step-by-step transition from existing tiered TRS Fund compensation rates toward a unitary, market-based compensation rate. On June 20, 2017, the FCC extended existing (2016-2017) VRS rates on a provisional basis. For VRS providers with more than 500,000 monthly minutes, the per-minute VRS compensation rates are: $4.06 for minutes that fall within Tier I (a provider's first 500,000 monthly minutes); $4.06 for minutes that fall within Tier II (a provider's second 500,000 monthly minutes); and $3.49 for minutes that fall within Tier III (a provider's monthly minutes in excess of 1,000,000). For VRS providers with 500,000 or fewer monthly minutes, the per-minute VRS compensation rate is $4.82. Based on these compensation rates, the maximum rates within the range of VRS rates proposed by the Commission, projected demand for the services, and projected Fund administration expenses, the FCC adopted a funding requirement of $1,328,188,285, and a carrier contribution factor of 0.02289. Congressional interest in the VRS program is twofold: eliminating fraud and abuse in the program and maintaining the usefulness of the program for users. Controversy has arisen over the latest proposals for change to the program being considered by the FCC. The FCC believes that rate structure changes are needed to reduce fraud and better manage the VRS program, but the deaf and hard-of-hearing community is concerned that funding cuts will result in fewer and less-qualified ASL interpreters. Additionally, the FCC has proposed changing the technologies used to operate and use the system, but the community is concerned that changes in technology will decrease the quality of the system as it is now and also potentially pose challenges to some users."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThis report provides a side-by-side comparison of three bills and two proposals— H.R. 6566 , H.R. 6670 , H.R. 6709 , H.R. 6899 (the House Leadership Proposal), and the Senate Draft Proposal—which address oil and gas development in the outer continental shelf (OCS). None of the bills has passed its respective chamber. The text below provides background on the issues. The side-by-side table gives a description of selected sections of the bills. President Bush announced on June 18, 2008, that he would like to open areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for oil and gas development currently under presidential and congressional moratoria (discussed in more detail below). The President stated that he would lift the executive branch moratoria only after Congress did so legislatively. But, on July 14, 2008, President Bush reversed his position and lifted the executive ban on the OCS imposed in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush. Senator John McCain, among others, has called on Congress to lift the offshore drilling moratoria as well. Further, the Administration proposes to begin planning its next five-year leasing program that would, if approved, be implemented as early as 2010—two years ahead of schedule. The proposed new five-year program would supersede the current five-year leasing program from 2007-2012. The Administration argues that a new five-year lease program beginning in 2010 would allow any newly opened OCS areas (if the congressional moratoria is lifted this year) to be offered in a lease sale sooner than if they remained on their current schedule. Since the President lifted the executive ban, members of Congress have introduced legislation that would lift the congressional prohibition (in part or completely) against leasing and development of oil and natural gas in the OCS. The legislation section of this report summarizes several of those bills, including the House Leadership proposal ( H.R. 6899 ). Many in Congress, however, oppose lifting the offshore ban. They argue that there are still several million acres leased onshore and offshore but not yet producing and that production from these lands could increase U.S. oil supply. On September 16, 2008, the House passed H.R. 6899 by a vote of 236-189 and defeated an alternative bill, H.R. 6709 , by a vote of 191-226. How much oil could be brought into production in the short-term (from non-producing leased lands or those under the moratoria) and its impact on price is uncertain. An attempt to lift the offshore moratoria with an amendment to the FY2009 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill during the House subcommittee markup was defeated by a vote of 6-9. Meanwhile, on June 26, 2008, under suspension of the rules (which requires a two-thirds majority for passage), the House defeated a measure ( H.R. 6251 ) that would have increased rental fees on non-producing oil and gas leases, and denied new federal leases to those not diligently developing the leases they have. Oil and gas leasing has been prohibited on much of the outer continental shelf (OCS) since the 1980s. Congress has enacted OCS leasing moratoria for each of fiscal years 1982-2006 in the annual Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill (now the Interior and Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill), allowing leasing only in the Gulf of Mexico (except near Florida) and parts of Alaska. President George H.W. Bush in 1990 issued a presidential directive ordering the Department of the Interior (DOI) not to conduct offshore leasing or preleasing activity in areas covered by the annual legislative moratoria until 2000. In 1998, President Clinton extended the offshore leasing prohibition until 2012. Proponents of the moratoria contend that offshore drilling would pose unacceptable environmental risks and threaten coastal tourism industries, whereas supporters of expanded offshore leasing counter that more domestic oil and gas production is vital for the nation's energy security. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA), as amended, provides for the leasing of OCS lands in a manner that protects the environment and returns revenues to the federal government in the form of bonus bids, rents, and royalties. OCSLA requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit five-year leasing programs that specify the time, location, and size of the areas to be offered. Each five-year leasing program entails a lengthy multistep process that includes environmental impact statements. After a public comment period, a final proposed plan is submitted to the President and Congress. The latest plan went into effect July 1, 2002. Public hearings for the 2007-2012 leasing program are underway. States and interest groups are filing comments on future lease sale areas for the 2007-2012 leasing program. States with energy development off their shores in federal waters have been seeking a larger portion of the federal revenues generated in those areas. They particularly want more assistance for coastal areas that may be most affected by onshore and near-shore activities that support offshore energy development. Proponents of these proposals look to the rates at which funds are given to jurisdictions where onshore energy development occurs on federal lands within those jurisdictions. Coastal destruction has received more attention in Louisiana—especially hard-hit by hurricanes in 2005—where many square miles of wetlands have been lost to the ocean each year. Widespread energy-related development is thought to contribute to coastal losses. Currently, the affected states receive some revenue directly from offshore oil and gas leases in federal waters under section 8(g) of OCSLA and under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. P.L. 109-432 . This is in contrast to the 50% share of direct revenues to states that have onshore federal leases within their boundaries.

From a budgetary perspective, many of these programs are assumed to continue beyond their authorization; in fact, such continuing programs were estimated in 2014 to cost $468 billion for the extended FY2019-FY2023 period. That is, they have a \"baseline\" beyond the end of the farm bill that may be used to pay to continue those programs. However, a subset of programs that received mandatory funding does not have a baseline beyond the end of the farm bill. These are referred to as \"farm bill programs without a baseline.\" The 2014 farm bill contains 39 programs that received mandatory funding that do not have a baseline beyond FY2018. These programs received $2.8 billion during FY2014-FY2018. For these programs to continue, they would need to be allocated new budgetary authority. Funding for farm bill programs is provided in two ways: 1. By the authorization in the farm bill ( ma ndatory spending ). A bill pays for this spending with multiyear budget estimates when the law is enacted. 2. By subsequent appropriations ( d iscretionary spending ). These programs are authorized for their scope but are not funded in the farm bill. Mandatory programs often dominate farm bill policy and the debate over the farm bill budget. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline is a projection at a particular point in time of what future federal spending on mandatory programs would be under current law. This baseline is the benchmark against which proposed changes in law are measured. When a new bill is proposed that would affect mandatory spending, the impact ( score ) is measured in relation to the baseline. Changes that increase spending relative to the baseline have a positive score; those that decrease spending relative to the baseline have a negative score. Having a baseline essentially gives programs built-in future funding if policymakers decide that the programs should continue; straightforward reauthorization would not have a scoring effect. However, programs without a continuing baseline beyond the end of a farm bill do not have assured future funding; reauthorization would have a positive score that increases the bill's cost. This funding issue—and the difficult budget dynamics that it can cause for writing a new farm bill—was identified at least as early as 2009 by the former chief economist of the House Agriculture Committee. It was raised in Agriculture Committee hearings as early as 2010, was an issue when writing the 2014 farm bill, and continues to be mentioned. CBO develops the budget baseline under various laws and following the supervision of the House and Senate Budget Committees. Generally, a program with estimated mandatory spending in the last year of its authorization will be assumed to continue in the baseline as if there were no change in policy and it did not expire. This is the situation for most of the major, long-standing farm bill provisions such as the farm commodity programs or supplemental nutrition assistance. However, some programs may not be assumed to continue in the budget baseline beyond the end of a farm bill because they are either programs with estimated mandatory spending less than a minimum $50 million scoring threshold in the last year of the farm bill, or new programs established after 1997 for which the Budget Committees determined that the mandatory spending shall not extend beyond expiration. This decision may be made in consultation with the Agriculture Committees, perhaps either to reduce the program's 10-year cost when the farm bill was written or to prevent it from having a continuing baseline. CBO projects future government spending via its budget baselines and evaluates proposed bills via scoring estimates. But it has not specifically published a list of expiring farm bill programs without a continuing baseline. To compile this list, CRS analyzed the CBO score of the 2014 farm bill in conjunction with the statutory text of the law and current CBO baseline projections that were made under the rules listed above. Our criteria are that programs have estimated mandatory funding in the 2014 farm bill (as indicated by the 2014 CBO score and in the text of the law) but do not have a baseline beyond FY2018 (indicated either in the 2014 CBO score or in the current CBO baseline). Based on this analysis, 39 programs across 10 of the 12 titles of the farm bill do not have a continuing baseline after FY2018. These programs had estimated mandatory spending totaling $2.824 billion over the five-year window of the farm bill ( Table 1 ). Any extended authorization of these programs would be scored as new mandatory spending, which may require either offsets from existing baseline for other programs or an increase in net spending. As a share of the $489 billion five-year mandatory cost of the farm bill in 2014, programs without a baseline beyond FY2018 are relatively small: 0.6% of the total projected farm bill spending, or 2.5% of the total excluding the nutrition programs ( Table 1 ). However, the impact of programs without a baseline varies by title of the farm bill. For the rural development title, 100% of the mandatory spending in the 2014 farm bill was by programs that do not have baseline beyond FY2018. For the bioenergy and research titles, the share was at least one-half. At the other extreme, nutrition programs and the farm safety net—including crop insurance and the commodity programs—have less than 1% in programs without a continuing baseline. The 2014 farm bill has less exposure to programs without baseline than did the 2008 farm bill, which had 37 programs without baseline totaling an estimated $9 billion to $14 billion. The 2014 farm bill provided 29 of those 37 programs with $6.2 billion of mandatory funding over FY2014-FY2018. Some of those programs reappear on the current list of 2014 farm bill programs without baseline, while others either received a continuing baseline or were not reauthorized. Figure 1 and Table 2 present the 39 individual programs in the 2014 farm bill that do not have a budget baseline beyond FY2018. Figure 1 is grouped and sorted by title of the farm bill based on the amount of mandatory spending by programs without a baseline within each title. Table 2 is organized by the section number in the 2014 farm bill and grouped by title.", "completion": "response:\nThe 2014 farm bill (the Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. 113-79) provided mandatory funding for many programs. Some of these programs have a budget baseline beyond the end of the farm bill in FY2018, while others do not. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline is a projection at a particular point in time of what future federal spending on mandatory programs would be under current law. This baseline is the benchmark against which proposed changes in law are measured. This report identifies mandatory programs in the 2014 farm bill that lack a budget baseline and explains the significance of this for enacting a successor to the current farm bill. Generally, a program with estimated mandatory spending in the last year of its authorization will be assumed to continue in the baseline as if there were no change in policy and it did not expire. However, some programs may not be assumed to continue in the budget baseline, because the program had estimated mandatory spending less than a minimum $50 million scoring threshold in the last year of the farm bill, or the Budget Committees and/or Agriculture Committees determined that mandatory spending shall not extend beyond expiration. Having a baseline essentially gives programs built-in future funding if policymakers decide that the programs should continue. Programs without a continuing baseline beyond the end of farm bill do not have assured future funding. As such, any extended authorization of these latter programs would be scored as new mandatory spending. The 2014 farm bill contains 39 programs that received mandatory funding that do not have baseline beyond FY2018. These programs had estimated mandatory spending totaling $2.824 billion over the five-year farm bill. While this total may be a relatively small fraction of total farm bill spending (0.6% of the $489 billion five-year total projection), the effect may be particularly important to specific farm bill titles and to the programs' beneficiaries. Notable programs among this group include certain conservation programs; most of the bioenergy, rural development, and research title programs; various nutrition title pilot programs and studies; organic agriculture and farmers' market programs; trade promotion programs; and outreach to socially disadvantaged and military veteran farmers. If policymakers want to continue these programs in the next farm bill, they may need to find budgetary offsets to pay for the costs."}

(128) All the billsprovided for a recognition process very similar to that in S. 147 and H.R. 309 , but differed in various other provisions, including the determinationof land transfers to, and the jurisdictional powers of, a Native Hawaiian political entity. Thenature of the federal government's relationship to Native Hawaiians was an issue long beforethe 106th Congress, however, in both the Department of the Interior (129) and the halls ofCongress. Congress came closest to enacting a Native Hawaiian recognition bill in the 106thCongress, when the House passed H.R. 4904 . While the Senate did not passH.R. 4904, the bill would have been enacted through a provision in theConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 ( H.R. 4577 , P.L. 106-554 ), until a Senateconcurrent resolution removed the provision by correcting the enrollment of H.R.4577 ( S.Con.Res. 162 ). Table 1. Native Hawaiian Recognition Bills inCongress Congress has enacted a number of programs for Native Hawaiians, in addition to theHawaiian Home Lands program. (130) One concern among proponents of Native Hawaiianrecognition is that many or all of these federal programs for Native Hawaiians may beendangered if a Native Hawaiian political entity is not created. (131) Federal NativeHawaiian programs either are solely for Native Hawaiian communities or organizations orexplicitly include Native Hawaiian communities or organizations among the eligibleapplicants. Some of these programs benefit Indians as well. The programs provide a notinsignificant amount of federal dollars for Native Hawaiians. A 2003 report of the Councilfor Native Hawaiian Advancement estimated that in FY2002 over $70 million flowed intoHawaii because of such Native Hawaiian programs. (132) Among themajor federal Native Hawaiian programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) (133) are the following. Native Hawaiian Education Act ( P.L. 107-110 , Title VII, Part B); F2004obligations were $33.3 million, according to the CFDA.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Senate's emphasis on individual and minority rights, reflected in both its standing rules and chamber custom, can make it challenging for the chamber to achieve its various goals in a timely manner. For this reason, the Senate routinely chooses to set aside its standing rules by unanimous consent. This is done formally through UC agreements, which in many cases outline the terms under which specific legislation will be considered. Under recent practice, these UC agreements sometimes include a provision imposing a 60-vote requirement for approval of amendments or legislation, instead of the simple majority vote ordinarily required in the Senate. These amendments or measures are sometimes of a controversial nature with potential to be subjected to extended consideration or even a filibuster. By incorporating a 60-vote threshold, such UC agreements avoid the multiple requirements associated with Senate Rule XXII, both for invoking cloture and for consideration under cloture. Such UC agreements ensure that a measure will not be successful without the same level of super-majority support that would be required for cloture by stipulating that if the 60-vote threshold is not reached, the matter will be disposed of. As with all UC agreements, once agreed to, they can be altered only by the adoption of a further UC agreement. Several possible effects could result from the Senate choosing to impose a 60-vote threshold for the passage of legislation. First, for cases in which a large majority of Senators is in favor of or opposed to the question, the time that would ordinarily be required to invoke cloture can be avoided. Once a cloture petition has been submitted, it must lay over until the second calendar day that the Senate is in session before a vote on cloture occurs. For a cloture vote to be successful, in most cases three-fifths of all Senators must vote in the affirmative (i.e., 60 votes if there are no vacancies). If the cloture vote is successful, another 30 hours of consideration are in order before a vote on the underlying business must occur. Incorporating the 60-vote threshold into a UC agreement allows the Senate to bypass these time consuming requirements. Second, for cases in which a large majority either in favor of or against the question cannot be assumed, the 60-vote threshold accomplishes the same purpose as a filibuster by preventing or delaying passage, but without requiring the Senate to engage in extended debate. Thus, surrendering the right to filibuster may be more palatable if Senators are confident a measure will not pass without super-majority support. Another reason that a 60-vote threshold might be included in a UC agreement is that it presents Senators with an opportunity to vote directly on the underlying policy issue. Votes on cloture often fail and consequently a vote on the actual measure or amendment may never occur. The 60-vote threshold in a UC agreement has the effect of bypassing the procedural vote to grant Senators a direct vote on the policy issue at hand. Lastly, in many of these 60-vote threshold UC agreements, it is a pair (or group) of amendments or measures that are jointly held to the 60-vote requirement. Many of the pairs (or groups) are competing options for the same policy issue. This allows the Senate to debate and choose between contending alternatives in a timely and controlled manner. Although examples of UC agreements placing a similar 60-vote threshold provisions can be found dating from at least the early 1990s, the practice has increased in frequency over the last four years. Unanimous consent agreements that impose a 60-vote threshold may be agreed to at any time, either in advance, or during consideration. It is notable that unlike Senate rules requiring super majorities, which typically are framed in terms of a fraction either of the membership or those voting (e.g., two-thirds, three-fifths), these UC agreements explicitly state the number of votes required. Given that practices generally specify disposition for a question that achieves a majority vote, but not a super-majority vote imposed by unanimous consent, the language of these UC agreements typically provides for disposition of the amendment or measure if it fails to achieve the required 60 votes. Typically, the matter is withdrawn, but it could alternately be laid on the table or returned to the calendar For example, in one UC agreement, the Senate agreed that \"... two amendments be subject to a 60 affirmative vote threshold, and that if neither achieves that threshold, then it be withdrawn.\" Unanimous consent agreements including a 60-vote threshold may be used not just to avoid the steps associated with invoking cloture, but also to avoid a separate vote on waiving a point of order raised under the Congressional Budget Act. In the Senate, most points of order under the Budget Act may be waived by a vote of at least three-fifths of all Senators duly chosen and sworn (60 votes if there are no vacancies). In one UC agreement, the Senate agreed to a 60-vote threshold for the passage of a conference report stipulating that a vote on the waiving of a Budget Act point of order also be treated as a simultaneous vote on adoption.", "completion": "response:\nThe Senate frequently enters into unanimous consent agreements (sometimes referred to as \"UC agreements\" or \"time agreements\") that establish procedures for the consideration of legislation that the Senate is considering or will soon consider. In recent practice, such unanimous consent agreements have sometimes included a provision that would require a 60-vote threshold to be met for amendments or legislation to be considered agreed to, rather than the simple majority ordinarily required. These amendments or measures may be of a controversial nature with the potential for causing a filibuster. By incorporating a 60-vote threshold, such UC agreements avoid the multiple requirements imposed by Senate Rule XXII for invoking cloture, while preserving the same requirement for super-majority support.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nFederal lawmakers view many financial businesses as having an important role in the U.S. economy, and therefore warrant providing these businesses protection for their individual account holders against loss, should the firms fail. Such protections exist both to protect the individuals from risks they probably could not discern for themselves and to protect the economy against the effects of financial panics when failures occur. Panics, the attendant collapses of wealth, and severe consequences for the economy occurred before Congress created federal deposit insurance in 1934. Prior to the enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA; P.L. 110-343 ), government policy protected customers of depository institutions—banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions—in full for accounts up to $100,000 and up to $250,000 for retirement accounts. Although the enactment of EESA on September 23, 2008, immediately raised the maximum deposit insurance to $250,000, retirement accounts remain at $250,000 until December 31, 2009. Since then, Congress and the President enacted the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 (HFSTHA; P.L. 111-22 ), extending both the EESA increases and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC's) $30 billion borrowing authority from the U.S. Treasury to as much as $500 billion until 2013. Because of the wording of P.L. 111-22 , after 2013, it is possible that deposit insurance protection could revert back to the $100,000 and $250,000 for retirement accounts. Other institutions such as insurance companies, securities broker/dealers, and many pension funds receive government or government-sponsored guarantees on specified accounts. This report provides a summary of the major features of financial institutions' customer protection systems, reflecting safety-net provisions legislated over time, usually in reaction to specific financial collapses. Besides these explicit guarantees, regulatory bodies can attempt the rescue of failing financial enterprises, using many tools authorized by laws and regulations and often implemented in the background. Such tools include liquidity lending, arranging memoranda of understanding, issuing cease-and-desist orders against risky practices, and arranging mergers of weak entities into stronger institutions. If the entire financial economy seems threatened by pending collapse of either a sizeable financial institution that is \"too big to fail\" or many financial businesses collectively, the Federal Reserve (Fed) can step in as the lender of last resort to avert serious adverse consequences for the economy (e.g., use of the Fed's liberal bank liquidity policy immediately after the 911 attacks, and currently the subprime meltdown led to failures of institutions once believed to be too big to fail—Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG—all of which were or are being assisted by the federal government). Moreover, Congress may have to provide emergency funding when parts of the federal safety net are under severe pressure. The cleanup of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s and early 1990s, for example, required appropriated funds plus a new deposit insurance fund and regulator. A more recent example is the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which provided $700 billion to purchase distressed assets, and has been used to make direct capital investments in troubled financial institutions. An important conceptual distinction between support structures is who ultimately pays for the protection. Lawmakers originally created federal deposit insurance using a \"user fee\" model of insurance, in which the government owned and operated each insurance system and charged member banks for its use. Following the banking failures of the late 1980s ─ early 1990s, legislation moved deposit protection part way toward an alternative \"mutual\" model, in which the burden of financing the system falls more clearly on the banking industry. Mutual institutions are owned by their customers, such as saving associations' depositors and insurance companies' policyholders. As a result, some analysts now claim that the banking industry \"owns\" the deposit insurance fund (DIF) in mutual mode. However, when the FDIC begins to draw on its credit line at the U.S. Treasury, which it has never done before, the use of the credit line would move the system back to the user fee model as the banks would have to pay their FDIC assessments as well as pay back the borrowed funds to the federal government, which owns and operates the DIF. The ultimate guarantor of deposit insurance is the economic power of the federal government, particularly the power to tax. History has shown that deposit guarantees by governments beneath the federal level have universally been inadequate to prevent panics, runs, and severe economic damage when called upon. Industry-sponsored and state-level programs have contained the collapses of their covered entities only if the damages have been small. The troubled pension benefit arrangement remains mainly in user fee mode. Credit union share insurance, in contrast, more nearly follows the mutual model. Likewise, state insurance company guaranty and federally sponsored securities investor protection arrangements follow the mutual model. However, in the current financial crisis, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) has joined the FDIC in accepting an increased line of credit from the U.S. Treasury to resolve failing corporate credit unions and restoring the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). Corporate credit unions are owned by retail or natural credit unions. Corporate credit unions operate as wholesale credit unions providing financing, investments, and clearing services for natural credit unions. It was the corporate credit unions that suffered most of the industry's losses in the current subprime foreclosure turmoil. Consequently, like the FDIC, when the NCUA uses its U.S. Treasury credit line to stabilize the NCUSIF, it too would move closer to the user fee mode. The following tabulation lists the major elements and components of these safety nets. Table 1 compares account protection at depository institutions. Table 2 does the same for the non-depository supports. Readers may obtain further analysis of each system via the websites of the administering agencies noted. On October 23, 2008, in the midst of the current financial crisis, the FDIC announced its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee program to help unfreeze the U.S. short-term credit markets. At the time, financial institutions were not lending to each other, especially in the commercial paper market, which was almost completely frozen. The two-part program temporarily guarantees all new senior unsecured debt and fully guarantees funds in certain non-interest bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions issued between October 14, 2008, and June 30, 2009, with guarantees expiring no later than June 30, 2012. The FDIC expects these guarantees would restore the necessary confidence for investors to begin investing in obligations of depository institutions. Evidence suggests that these short-term markets returned to normal after the TLG program was implemented. The second part of the FDIC's TLG program is to guarantee 100% of non-interest-bearing transaction accounts held in insured depository institutions until December 31, 2009. This addresses the concern that many small business accounts, such as payroll accounts, frequently exceed the current maximum deposit insurance limit of $250,000. The TLG program is being paid for by additional fees placed on depository institutions that use these guarantees, not taxpayers.", "completion": "response:\nAfter the onset of the current financial crisis and economic contraction, the 111th Congress increased some of the long-standing provisions that protect account holders from risk. Specifically, provisions in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA; P.L. 110-343) and the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 (HFSTHA; P.L. 111-22) increased account holders' protection. Both laws raised the maximum deposit account insurance to $250,000, and the HFSTHA extended the higher level of risk protection until 2013. Lawmakers have long recognized the importance of protecting some forms of financial savings from risk. Such provisions apply to deposits in banks and thrift institutions and credit union \"shares.\" Remedial and other safety net features also cover insurance contracts, certain securities accounts, and even defined-benefit pensions. Questions over how to fund and guarantee Social Security, along with the troubles of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, have renewed interest in these arrangements. This report portrays the salient features and legislation of account protection provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), state insurance guaranty funds, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. It provides a discussion of the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLG) , which extends unlimited temporary deposit guarantees to certain depositors and debt held in insured depository institutions. Overall, the report provides a summary of the major federal risk protections for account holders. This report will be updated as appropriate."}

This report describes and compares the bills and provisions that directly address climate change, as opposed to those that primarily address other issues (e.g., energy efficiency) but could have ancillary impacts on climate. In some cases, it is difficult to distinguish between direct and indirect climate change bills, because a specific bill or action may seek to achieve multiple objectives. This report focuses on legislative actions—including comprehensive bills with individual climate change titles, sections, or provisions—that explicitly address climate change issues. The provisions in these bills fall into six general categories: 1. carbon price (i.e., tax or fee) on greenhouse (GHG) emissions; 2. other mechanisms intended to encourage mitigation of GHG emissions (e.g., sequestration of emissions); 3. research on climate change-related issues; 4. adaptation activities related to expected climate change impacts; 5. support for international climate change-related activities; and 6. action that limits or prohibits climate change-related authorities, efforts, or considerations. Table 1 lists the proposals in the 113 th Congress by these six broad categories. These categories are not mutually exclusive, and several bills address more than one of the above categories. Other reviews of the same legislation may identify a different list of bills with different categorization. Table 2 provides a brief summary about each bill, including the primary sponsor, short title, major actions, and key climate change-related provisions. As of the date of this report, one bill— S. 332 (Sanders)—would attach a price to GHG emissions. Table 3 compares that carbon price proposal with selected state and international programs.

Observations about the climate change-related proposals in the 113th Congress include the following: a large number of the identified bills include provisions to encourage or require climate change adaptation activities; a considerable number of proposals include provisions to prohibit federal agencies, particularly the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), from taking action to require greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions; and as of the date of this report, one bill (S. 332) would attach a price to GHG emissions. As of the date of this report, the President has signed one bill into law (P.L. 113-79) that includes climate change-related provisions. Among other provisions, this act (often referred to as the \"Farm Bill\") reauthorizes the Office of International Forestry through FY2018 and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the strategic plan for forestry inventory to include information on renewable biomass supplies and carbon stocks. In addition, the House has passed three bills: H.R. 367 (passed on August 2, 2013) would require any rule that implements or provides for the imposition or collection of a carbon tax to be submitted to Congress for an affirmative vote and presentment to the President before the regulation could take effect; H.R. 2641 (passed on March 6, 2014) would prohibit a lead agency from using the social cost of carbon in an environmental review or decision-making process; and H.R. 3826 (passed on March 6, 2014) would prohibit EPA from issuing a rule that would establish GHG performance standards at electric generators unless specific conditions are met."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program under which the federal government gives annual grants to states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and commonwealths, and Indian tribal organizations to operate multi-component home energy assistance programs for needy households. Established in 1981 by Title XXVI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( P.L. 97-35 ), LIHEAP has been reauthorized and amended several times, most recently in 2005, when the Energy Policy Act ( P.L. 109-58 ) reauthorized annual regular LIHEAP funds at $5.1 billion per year from FY2005 to FY2007. The total LIHEAP appropriation in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 110-161 ) was approximately $2.57 billion. In FY2007 Congress appropriated $2.16 billion for the program ( P.L. 110-5 ), and in FY2006, $3.161 billion was appropriated for LIHEAP ( P.L. 109-149 and P.L. 109-204 ), the largest amount ever appropriated for the program. The LIHEAP statute provides for two types of program funding: regular funds and contingency funds. This report focuses on the distribution of regular funds, sometimes referred to as block grant funds, which are allotted to states according to methods prescribed by the LIHEAP statute. The allotment method may change depending on the amount of funds appropriated by Congress. In both FY2007 and FY2008, $1.98 billion was allocated to regular funds, and in FY2006, $2.48 billion of the LIHEAP appropriation was distributed as regular funds. The second type of LIHEAP funding, called contingency funds, may be released and allotted to one or more states at the discretion of the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). The contingency funds may be released at any point in the fiscal year to meet additional home energy assistance needs created by a natural disaster or other emergency. Of the total appropriated for LIHEAP in FY2008, approximately $590 million was for contingency funds. In the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 110-161 ), Congress appropriated $1.98 billion for the LIHEAP regular fund. P.L. 110-161 contained an across-the-board rescission of 1.747% that reduced the stated amounts appropriated for most Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education programs. The $1.98 billion appropriation for regular funds is the amount available after this rescission. The first distribution to the states of the regular funds appropriated in P.L. 110-161 occurred in December 2007. Then, on June 26, 2008, HHS announced that it would distribute funds that were thought to have been allocated to leveraging incentive and REACH grants in the FY2008 Appropriations Act as part of the regular fund formula grants. Since the early 1990s, leveraging incentive and REACH grants have been made to states and tribes on the basis of their ability to obtain non-LIHEAP resources for energy assistance (leveraging incentive grants) and for increasing energy efficiency of low-income households (REACH grants). In recent years, Congress has allocated around $27 million for these two funds. However, in FY2008, P.L. 110-161 did not appropriate funds for leveraging incentive and REACH grants. When HHS discovered that language to appropriate the funds was missing from the law, it released the $26.7 million that would otherwise have been distributed as leveraging incentive and REACH grants as part of the LIHEAP formula distribution. The addition of nearly $27 million to the formula grants caused the funds to be released under the \"new\" LIHEAP formula. For more information about how the LIHEAP formula distributes funds, see CRS Report RL33275, The LIHEAP Formula: Legislative History and Current Law , by [author name scrubbed]. Column (c) of Table 1 shows the amount of funds that were initially allocated to the states in FY2008 before HHS discovered that the leveraging incentive grants had not been appropriated in P.L. 110-161 . Column (d) shows the total distributed to the states on June 26, 2008, which includes the $26.7 million in leveraging incentive grants. Column (b) of Table 1 shows the amounts allocated to the states in FY2007. For FY2009, the President has requested a total of $2 billion for LIHEAP; of this amount, $1.7 billion would be allocated to regular funds.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThis report provides a cumulative history of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy compared with funding for the other energy technologies—nuclear energy, fossil energy, energy efficiency, and electric systems. Specifically, it provides a comparison that covers cumulative funding over the past 10 years (FY2009-FY2018), a second comparison that covers the 41-year period since DOE was established at the beginning of FY1978 through FY2018, and a third comparison that covers a 71-year funding history (FY1948-FY2018) for DOE and predecessor agencies. The final amount of FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ), which was signed by the President on May 5, 2017. The act contained appropriations for all FY2017 appropriations bills, including Energy and Water Development programs (Division D). Final funding for FY2018 was set by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), which was signed by the President on May 23, 2018. Funding levels for DOE are included in Energy and Water Development programs (Division D). Figure 1 presents the fiscal year funding totals for DOE in real terms (2016 dollars) since 1978 for each technology or energy source. Table 1 shows the cumulative funding totals in real terms (2016 dollars) for the past 10 years (first column), 41 years (second column), and 71 years (third column). Table 2 converts the data from Table 1 into relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source, expressed as a percentage of total spending for each period. Figure 2 displays the data from the first column of Table 2 as a pie chart. That chart shows the relative shares of cumulative DOE spending for each technology or energy source over the 10 years from FY2009 through FY2018. Figure 3 provides a similar chart for the period from FY1978 through FY2018. Figure 4 shows a chart for FY1948 through FY2018. The availability of energy—especially gasoline and other liquid fuels—played a critical role in World War II. Another energy-related factor was the application of research and development (R&D) to the atomic bomb (Manhattan Project) and other military technologies. During the post-World War II era, the federal government began to apply R&D to the peacetime development of energy sources to support economic growth. At that time, the primary R&D focus was on fossil fuels and new forms of energy derived from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which inherited all of the Manhattan Project's R&D activities and placed nuclear weapon development and nuclear power management under civilian control. A major focus of the AEC was research on \"atoms for peace,\" the use of nuclear energy for civilian electric power production. Prompted by the oil embargo declared by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1973, the Federal Energy Administration was established in mid-1974. In early 1975, the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) was established, incorporating the AEC and several energy programs that had been operating under the Department of the Interior and other federal agencies. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established by law in 1977, incorporating activities of the FEA and ERDA. All of the energy R&D programs—fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency—were brought under its administration. DOE also undertook a small program in energy storage and electricity system R&D that supports the four main energy technology programs. From FY1948 through FY1977, the majority of federal government support for energy R&D focused on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies. Total spending on fossil energy technologies over that period amounted to about $17.1 billion, in constant FY2016 dollars. The federal government spent about $51.6 billion (in constant FY2016 dollars) during that period for nuclear energy R&D (in all the tables and figures in this report, the \"nuclear\" category includes both fission and fusion). The energy crises of the 1970s spurred the federal government to expand its R&D programs to include renewable (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, hydro) energy and energy efficiency technologies. Comparatively modest efforts to support renewable energy and energy efficiency began during the early 1970s. Since FY1978, DOE has been the main supplier of energy R&D funding compared to other federal agencies. In real (constant dollar) terms, funding support for all four of the main energy technologies skyrocketed during the 1970s to a combined peak in FY1979 at about $8.6 billion (2016 constant dollars). Funding then dropped steadily, to about $2.0 billion (2016 dollars) per year during the late 1990s. Since then, funding has increased gradually—except that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) provided a one-year spike of $13 billion (2016 dollars) in FY2009. For FY2018, DOE energy R&D funding stood at nearly $4.5 billion (2016 dollars).", "completion": "response:\nEnergy-related research and development (R&D)—on coal-based synthetic petroleum and on atomic bombs—played an important role in the successful outcome of World War II. In the postwar era, the federal government conducted R&D on fossil and nuclear energy sources to support peacetime economic growth. The energy crises of the 1970s spurred the government to broaden the focus to include renewable energy and energy efficiency. Over the 41-year period from the Department of Energy's (DOE's) inception at the beginning of FY1978 through FY2018, federal funding for renewable energy R&D amounted to about 18% of the energy R&D total, compared with 6% for electric systems, 16% for energy efficiency, 24% for fossil, and 37% for nuclear. For the 71-year period from 1948 through 2018, nearly 13% went to renewables, compared with nearly 5% for electric systems, 11% for energy efficiency, 24% for fossil, and 48% for nuclear."}

The German federal election of September 18, 2005,had produced no clear winner or direction for the next government. Some see this government asshort-lived and unlikely to succeed, while others believe that only such a coalition has the combinedstrength to implement potentially painful but needed economic and social benefits reforms, assumingthat it can overcome partisan politics. Foreign policy is likely to play a secondary and lesscontentious role, given the press of domestic business and a general consensus on most internationalissues. The atmosphere of U.S.- German relations has already improved since the Merkelgovernment took office, as reflected by the successful first official visit of Chancellor Merkel toWashington on January 13, 2006. On May 22, 2005, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder surprised his country byannouncing that he would seek early federal elections in September 2005, a year ahead of schedule. His decision followed the resounding defeat suffered by his Social Democrats (SPD) in the stateelection in North Rhine-Westphalia, a traditional SPD stronghold. (2) This was the most recent ina string of state election losses that had given the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) oppositionfirm control of the German Bundesrat (upper house of parliament). The sluggish economy,persistently high unemployment, as well as concern about welfare and labor reforms, both enactedand planned, were widely seen as principal reasons for the SPD defeat. Early elections are rare in Germany because the German Basic Law (Constitution) makes itvery difficult for the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) to be dissolved. Only the President candissolve parliament and only after a vote of no confidence in the government. German PresidentHorst Kohler set new elections for September 18, 2005 after the Bundestag held a vote of noconfidence in the government which the Chancellor himself initiated on July 1, 2005. Before theelection was held, the decision was reviewed and approved by the German Constitutional Court. The election gave no party the necessary majority with its preferred coalition partner. Although the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) got the most votesby a slim margin, it had an unexpectedly weak showing compared to pre-election polls and in lightof the general disgruntlement with the previous government. Analysts attributed the weak showingto the fact that voters were deeply skeptical of whether a CDU/CSU government could accomplishmore than its predecessor and were also worried about some of the CDU reform ideas. Accordingto official results, the CDU/CSU received 35.2 percent of the vote, barely beating out the SocialDemocrats (SPD) with 34.3 percent of the vote. This left neither party in a position to form agovernment with just its most likely coalition partner. The Free Democratic Party (FDP) actuallydid better than expected with 9.8 percent of the vote and ahead of the Greens who received 8.1percent. The new Left Party, a union of east German former communists and a breakaway factionof the SPD, received 8.9 percent of the vote, enough to be seated as a faction in the Bundestag. Theformer communist party (PDS) did not achieve the 4 percent threshold to gain seats in theBundestag. Voter turnout was 77.7 percent, slightly less than in the 2002 election. (3) Table 1.

Some experts believe that the coalition will befragile, short lived, and will accomplish little with each side trying to gain political advantage overthe other. Such negative expectations are not shared by other analysts who believe that only sucha large coalition can implement potentially painful but needed economic and social reforms,assuming that it can overcome partisan politics. The most difficult and crucial areas on which the coalition must cooperate if the governmentis to succeed involve social and economic policy. Government success will be important, not justfor Germany, but also for Europe and global economic health. Experts believe that Angela Merkel,as Chancellor, wants to speed domestic social and economic reforms. It is not clear whether she willhave broader domestic support to do so, especially among the SPD base. Many observers expect more continuity than change in German foreign policy under the\"grand coalition\" government. On most issues, the CDU/CSU and the SPD are not far apart.Germany is expected to continue to give priority to multilateral approaches to solving internationalproblems. Many expect Chancellor Merkel to balance traditional strong Franco-German cooperationwithin the EU with closer ties to the United Kingdom, and other countries such as Italy, Spain, andPoland. She is expected to pursue European integration as a corollary rather than in opposition to thetransatlantic partnership. U.S. officials and many experts hope for improvement in U.S.-German bilateral relationsunder the Merkel-led government. Merkel has given priority to reducing the strains in transatlanticrelations, as well as improving negative German public opinion regarding the United States. The newGerman government is unlikely to fundamentally change the German stand on Iraq, meaning thatit will provide some financial and training assistance outside Iraq, but no military personnel on theground. It is likely to continue to take a lead in efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Chancellor Merkelis expected to continue Germany's domestic and international efforts to combat terrorism. TheUnited States, Germany, and the EU are working together to oppose Iran's development of nuclearweapons. Chancellor Merkel has indicated that she will not support a lifting of the EU armsembargo against China, which the United States also opposes. A number of differences are likelyto continue even under the Merkel government, such as on the treatment of terror suspect prisoners,extra-judicial \"renditions,\" environmental policy, and the International Criminal Court. ChancellorMerkel's first official visit to Washington and her talks with President Bush on January 13, 2006,were designed to demonstrate that a new positive chapter had opened in bilateral relations, althoughdifferences were discussed candidly. The two leaders agreed on most points, including the urgencyof addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions. This report will be updated."}

In some instances, the President makes these appointments using authorities granted by law to the President alone. Other appointments are made with the advice and consent of the Senate via the nomination and confirmation of appointees. Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation are often referred to with the abbreviation PAS. This report identifies, for the 113 th Congress, all nominations submitted to the Senate for executive-level full-time positions in the 15 executive departments for which the Senate provides advice and consent. It excludes appointments to regulatory boards and commissions as well as to independent and other agencies, which are covered in other CRS reports. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) ( http://www.lis.gov/nomis/ ) , the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents , telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code , and the 2012 Plum Book ( United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions ). Related Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports regarding the presidential appointments process, nomination activity for other executive branch positions, recess appointments, and other appointments-related matters may be found at http://www.crs.gov . Table 1 summarizes appointment activity, during the 113 th Congress, related to full-time PAS positions in the 15 executive departments. President Barack H. Obama submitted 273 nominations to the Senate for full-time positions in executive departments. Of these 273 nominations, 162 were confirmed; 8 were withdrawn; and 103 were returned to the President under the provisions of Senate rules. The length of time a given nomination may be pending in the Senate has varied widely. Some nominations were confirmed within a few days, others were confirmed within several months, and some were never confirmed. This report provides, for each executive department nomination confirmed in the 113 th Congress, the number of days between nomination and confirmation (\"days to confirm\"). For confirmed nominations, a mean of 119.2 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 92.0. Under Senate Rules, nominations not acted on by the Senate at the end of a session of Congress (or before a recess of 30 days) are returned to the President. The Senate, by unanimous consent, often waives this rule—although not always. This report measures the \"days to confirm\" from the date of receipt of the resubmitted nomination, not the original. Each of the 15 executive department profiles provided in this report is divided into two parts: (1) a table listing the organization's full-time PAS positions as of the end of the 113 th Congress and (2) a table listing appointment action for vacant positions during the 113 th Congress. Data for these tables were collected from several authoritative sources, as listed earlier. In each department profile, the first of these two tables identifies, as of the end of the 113 th Congress, each full-time PAS position in that department and its pay level. For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule. As of the end of the 113 th Congress, these pay levels ranged from level I ($201,700) for Cabinet-level offices to level V ($147,200) for lower-ranked positions. The second table, the appointment action table, provides, in chronological order, information concerning each nomination. It shows the name of the nominee, position involved, date of nomination or appointment, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation. It also notes actions other than confirmation (e.g., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President). The appointment action tables with more than one nominee to a position also list statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. Each appointment action table provides the average days to confirm in two ways: mean and median. Although the mean is a more familiar measure, it may be influenced by outliers in the data. The median, by contrast, does not tend to be influenced by outliers. In other words, a nomination that took an extraordinarily long time might cause a significant change in the mean, but the median would be unaffected. Examining both numbers offers more information with which to assess the central tendency of the data. For a small number of positions within a department, the two tables may contain slightly different titles for the same position. This is because the title used in the nomination the White House submits to the Senate, the title of the position as established by statute, and the title of the position used by the department itself are not always identical. The first table listing incumbents at the end of the 113 th Congress uses data provided by the department itself. The second table listing nomination action within each department relies primarily upon the Senate nominations database of the LIS. This information is based upon the nomination sent to the Senate by the White House. Any inconsistency in position titles between the two tables is noted in the notes following each appointment table. Appendix A provides two tables. Table A-1 relists all appointment action identified in this report and is organized alphabetically by the appointee's last name. Table entries identify the agency to which each individual was appointed, position title, nomination date, date confirmed or other final action, and duration count for confirmed nominations. The table also includes the mean and median values for the \"days to confirm\" column. Table A-2 provides summary data for each of the 15 executive departments identified in this report. The table summarizes the number of positions, nominations submitted, individual nominees, confirmations, nominations returned, and nominations withdrawn for each department. It also provides the mean and median values for the numbers of days taken to confirm nominations within each department. A list of department abbreviations can be found in Appendix B . Appendix A.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nSection 202 of the Social Security Act states that benefits are paid through the month before the month in which a beneficiary dies. Thus, no benefits are paid for the month of death. This rule has been in the law since 1939. The rule does not apply to Medicare, which provides benefits up to the date of death. Social Security benefits are paid on a monthly basis. The check (or direct bank deposit) for each month's benefit is issued in the following month. For example, the check that an individual receives in February is the benefit payable for January. This is referred to as a retrospective payment system. If a beneficiary dies late in the month, family members or the executor of the estate may not notify the Social Security Administration (SSA) in time to stop the payment. Subsequently, they are informed that the check must be returned to the government. Members of Congress are asked often to support legislation that would provide a full or partial benefit payment for the month of death. The following section presents common arguments for and against paying Social Security benefits for the month of death. Critics of the current policy argue that withholding benefits for the month of death does not make sense. They maintain that a person's bills do not stop at the beginning of the month in which they die. Moreover, the deceased beneficiary's family members or estate have to pay funeral and burial expenses. The unfairness of the policy is often illustrated with a comparison of the individual who dies on the last day of the month and receives no benefit for that month, and the individual who dies at 12:05 a.m. the next day and receives a full benefit for the preceding month. Critics complain that the current policy is cruel in that it adversely affects individuals who are already distressed by the death of a family member. They find the circumstances in which a check must be returned to the government to be the most incomprehensible. Persons who are affected often ask questions such as Do you mean my father (or mother) had to live each day of their final month to get a benefit for that month? Why are family members placed at a disadvantage when a beneficiary dies at the end of the month after having incurred living expenses throughout most of the month? How could the government have established such a policy? Critics contend that the public views the policy as an anomaly—as a mistake in the design of the Social Security system. If the policy was intended to reduce the cost of the system, they see it as a \"poor\" device to do so. They argue that the policy discredits the system by creating the impression that it is arbitrary, unbending, and thoughtlessly bureaucratic. They maintain that benefits should be paid at least for the part of the month that the beneficiary was alive. Supporters of the current policy argue that paying benefits for the month of death would be costly. SSA estimates that paying full benefits for the month of death would cost $1.6 billion annually. Alternatively, paying 50% of the benefit if the beneficiary dies in the first half of the month, and a full benefit if the beneficiary dies in the second half of the month, would cost an estimated $1.2 billion annually. Pro-rating the benefit based on the number of days the beneficiary was alive during the final month would cost an estimated $800 million annually. SSA also estimated the increase in benefit payments under a proposal in which (1) a full benefit for the month of death would be payable to a surviving spouse (the surviving spouse would not be required to have been living with the beneficiary when the death occurred or to be entitled to benefits), or (2) if there is no surviving spouse, a pro-rated benefit based on the number of days the beneficiary was alive during the final month would be payable. SSA estimated that the proposal would increase benefit payments by $13.2 billion over 10 years (2004-2013). Supporters of the current policy also point out that the system pays benefits to an individual beginning with his or her first month of entitlement, regardless of when entitlement began during the month, and that this provides rough balance in the system for not paying benefits for the month of death. Moreover, survivor benefits are payable to eligible family members beginning with the deceased beneficiary's month of death, regardless of when the death occurred during the month. In addition, the spouse who was living with the worker, or a spouse or child eligible for survivor benefits, may receive a Social Security lump-sum death payment of $255. They contend that there is little appreciation for the administrative difficulties (and potential costs) involved in determining who should receive the deceased beneficiary's benefit for the month of death. Because SSA cannot simply mail a check to the deceased beneficiary, SSA would have to determine who should receive the payment. Given that more than 2 million beneficiaries die each year, this would require a labor-intensive process, similar to the taking of regular benefit applications. Each case would have to be investigated, and if there are multiple family members, the payment may have to be split. Careful attention would have to be given to determining the proper payee(s) in each case.", "completion": "response:\nSocial Security benefits are not paid for the month in which a beneficiary dies. In most cases, the check that an individual receives in a given month represents payment for the preceding month. In other words, by design, the check (or direct bank deposit) arrives after the month for which it applies. In cases where a beneficiary dies late in the month, the Social Security Administration often is not notified of the death in time to stop the payment. When family members are informed that the check must be returned, they often complain that the policy is unfair and creates a financial hardship because the deceased beneficiary incurred expenses for part (or even most) of the month. Over the years, legislation has been introduced that would provide a full benefit for the month of death or a pro-rated benefit based on the proportion of the month that the beneficiary was alive. Supporters of such legislation argue that withholding benefits for the month of death does not make sense given that a person's bills do not stop at the beginning of the month in which they die. They argue that the public views the policy as anomalous in a system designed to provide monthly income to retirees, the disabled, and survivors of deceased workers. Critics of such legislation argue that paying full benefits for the month of death would cost an estimated $1.6 billion annually (excluding administrative costs). They point out that a deceased beneficiary's spouse and children can collect survivor benefits for the month of death, regardless of when the death occurred; that survivors may be entitled to a $255 lump-sum death payment; and that those seeking to have benefits paid for the month of death have little appreciation for the administrative difficulties involved in determining who should get the more than 2 million final benefit checks issued each year."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe tax rates which determine investment activity are marginal tax rates on new investment. They are calculated by projecting the path of a new investment and discounting the flow of income and taxes. They take into account the effects of statutory tax rates, depreciation rules, investment subsidies, and inflation. The method is to compare the internal rate that discounts the flow to the current value of investment with taxes (the after-tax return) and the rate without taxes (the pre-tax return); the difference between these rates divided by the pre-tax return is the effective tax rate. Table 1 shows the estimated tax rates from 1953 to 2005. Column 2 presents estimates of the corporate firm-level tax; if depreciation were allowed at economic rates and there were no subsidies, this rate would equal the corporate statutory tax rate. Column 3 reports estimates of the total rate on corporate investment, accounting for the deductibility of interest at the firm level and the taxation of interest, dividends, and capital gains at the individual level, as well as depreciation and subsidies. Column 4 presents the estimated rates for unincorporated business (proprietorships and partnerships). These business tax rates reflect investments in equipment, structures, and inventory. Column 5 presents estimated tax rates for owner-occupied housing, which is normally close to zero because of the exclusion of implicit net rent from income. Column 6 provides a weighted economy-wide tax rate. As shown in Table 1 , tax rates for business investment fell from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s, reflecting more accelerated depreciation, investment credits, and lower statutory tax rates. Rates rose towards the end of the 1960s with the repeal of the investment credit, which was restored in 1971 and led to lower rates. Rates then began to rise in the mid-1970s as inflation resulted in a smaller value of depreciation deductions by firms; inflation also caused the penalty for not deducting mortgage interest for non-itemizers to become more severe. Increases in depreciation and lower rates adopted in 1981, which were followed by more restrictive depreciation but lower corporate and individual rates in 1986 and slowing inflation, led to lower tax rates in the 1980s and 1990s. The most recent reductions in tax rates arose from the lower tax rates adopted in the 2001-2003 legislation, the adoption of bonus depreciation in 2002 which was expanded in 2003, and the lower rates on dividends and capital gains adopted in 2003. These changes resulted in a historically low tax rate. The tax rate rose in 2004 due to higher inflation rates, and rose again in 2005 due to the end of bonus depreciation. Lower rates on capital gains are technically temporary (expiring in 2010), but may be made permanent. The tax rates in Table 1 do not account for the tax benefits to investments through pensions and individual retirement accounts (where tax rates are generally effectively zero); about half of passive income (interest, dividends, and capital gains on stock) is received in tax exempt form. These provisions affect marginal tax rates only if they affect the return to the marginal saving decision. Many investments in these forms are made up to the maximum contribution limit, many pension plans are not under individual control, and even where investments are not at the limit all marginal investments may still not flow through the tax-favored account. All of these factors suggest not including these tax benefits in marginal calculations. However, there is probably some marginal effect, and if the individual income tax rate on these passive forms of income is set to one half of its value to reflect the share of non-taxed investment returns, tax rates would be reduced substantially—by about eight percentage points without the lower rates (particularly on dividends and capital gains) enacted recently; about six percentage points otherwise. The basic formula for calculating the effective tax rate is , where r is the pre-tax return, or internal discount rate for an investment with no taxes, and R is the after-tax discount rate that discounts all flows to the cost of the investment with taxes. For a business depreciable investment, the relationship between r and R, with R the firm's discount rate, derived from an investment with geometric depreciation and continuous time, is the standard formula: (1) where u is the firm's statutory tax rate (either the individual or corporate rate), is the economic depreciation rate, z is the present discounted value of depreciation deductions, k is the investment tax credit, and a is a determinant of the basis adjustment, set at one, 0.5, and zero if there is a full basis adjustment (i.e. depreciation allowed only on cost net of the credit), half basis adjustment, or no basis adjustment respectively. The formula in (1) is applied to obtain firm-level tax rates (the firm-level corporate rate in column 2 and the non-corporate rate in column 4), with R a weighted average of the after-tax real interest rate where I is the interest rate and is the inflation rate and the required real return on equity before individual tax. Debt is weighted one-third. In the case of total corporate tax rates in column 3, the pre-tax return R is derived from equation (1) but is compared with the return after personal taxes to individuals (the same discount rate used for non-corporate business), a weighted average of the after-tax real return on debt , where t is the individual tax rate, and the after-tax return on corporate equity (which is net of taxes on capital gains and dividends). In the case of the firm level corporate tax rate in the second column of Table 1 , R is the discount rate of the corporate firm (before personal level taxes). The tax rate for owner-occupied housing omits the effect of depreciation and taxes on profit—the pre tax return is simply , where f is the debt share, n is the share of investments with individuals who itemize on their tax returns, p is the property tax rate, and R is the after-tax discount rate. If all mortgage interest deductions were allowed, but no property tax deductions, the tax rate would be zero because there is no tax on the imputed net rent. A slight positive or negative tax may arise because of the inability to deduct mortgage interest by non-itemizers and the ability to deduct property taxes by itemizers. The mathematical formulas and assumptions used to calculate tax rates, including depreciation methods and lives, investment credits, inflation rates, and statutory tax rates, as well as the tax rates themselves for 1953-1989, can be found in [author name scrubbed], The Economic Effects of Taxing Capital Income , Cambridge: MIT Press, 1994, Appendix B, pp. 287-301. The statutory tax rates, interest and inflation rates for 1953-1989 are in Table 2.1, p. 20. Tax rates for 1990-2005 incorporate a number of assumptions and tax law changes. These include the increase in the tax life for structures from 31.5 to 39 years in 1993, the lowering of the capital gains tax rate to 20% in 1997, the introduction of bonus depreciation (expensing of a share of investment) at 30% for 2002 and 50% for 2003 and 2004, and the reduction in the tax rate for capital gains and dividends from 20% and the regular tax rate respectively to 15%. Individual and corporate statutory tax rates and inflation and interest rates are reported in Table 2 for 1990-2005. The pattern of change in individual tax rates is based on the rate reported for the NBER simulation model, which can be found at http://www.nber.org/~taxsim/mrates/mrates3.html , visited November 20, 2003. Tax rates are assumed to continue at the current year's rate; slightly lower rates would occur for 2001 and 2002 if the permanent long term rates enacted in 2001 were assumed, although rates might also rise due to real bracket creep as well. Inflation rates are a 1/3 weight of the prior year and a two-thirds weight of the current year. The interest rate is the Baa Bond rate.", "completion": "response:\nEffective marginal tax rates on investment are forward-looking estimates that project over the lifetime of an investment what share of the return will effectively be paid in taxes. These rates can differ significantly from average tax rates measured by dividing tax liability by income, because they are affected by timing. Effective tax rates fell from the early 1950s through the mid-1960s, rose until the early 1980s, and then dropped. They have stayed about the same until relatively recently, when they fell to an all-time low with bonus depreciation, relief of double tax on dividends, and lower marginal tax rates. The end of bonus deprecation and higher inflation rates increased the tax rates in the past two years. This report will be updated as warranted."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOn January 5, 2007, Adrian Fenty, the mayor of the District Columbia, released a detailed legislative proposal that would transfer administrative, policy making, and budgetary authority for the District of Columbia's public schools from the District of Columbia Board of Education to the mayor. The proposal, \"The District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007\" (Education Reform Act), was introduced one day after the mayor was sworn in. Key elements of the proposal would create a new cabinet-level department for public school education to be managed by a \"Chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools,\" appointed by the mayor with the advice and consent of the city council; reduce the authority and power of the Board of Education from an independent governing and policymaking entity to an advisory body to the mayor; and transfer the current Board of Education charter-school authority to the State Education Office. transfer the authority to set the budget for the District of Columbia schools to the mayor. Congress's authority to review, amend, and approve or disapprove the mayor's education proposal is derived from the \"District Clause\" of the Constitution, which states that Congress has the power To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States. In 1973, Congress passed the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, P.L. 93-198 (Home Rule Act), which granted the District citizens an elected form of government with limited home rule. The Home Rule Act gave District voters the right to elect a mayor, a city council, and an independent Board of Education. It also outlined the powers afforded to the D.C. Council and the retention of Congress's constitutional authority to legislate within the District. This retention of constitutional authority is recognized in the Home Rule Act and the D.C. Code, which states Â§ 1-206.01 Retention of constitutional authority. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Congress of the United States reserves the right, at any time, to exercise its constitutional authority as legislature for the District, by enacting legislation for the District on any subject, whether within or without the scope of legislative power granted to the council by this chapter, including legislation to amend or repeal any law in force in the District prior to or after enactment of this chapter and any act passed by the city council. The proposed Education Reform Act contemplates two concurrent avenues for achieving a proposed restructuring of the District of Columbia public school system: (1) passage of legislation by the city council, and (2) congressional amendment of the Home Rule Act. The majority of the reorganization proposal could be implemented by the city council acting under its delegated authority to reorganize agencies of the District of Columbia. However, the Education Reform Act also contemplates that the Congress would pass legislation amending two provisions of the Home Rule Act: (1) the authorizing language for the D.C. School Board, and (2) restrictions on the budgetary authority of the city council and mayor over the D.C. schools. To the extent that Congress sought to legislate beyond the two issues contemplated in the proposed Education Reform Act, it could pass legislation implementing any or all other aspects of the proposed act itself. This report does not address the issue of whether that portion of the Education Reform Act which currently contemplates action by Congress to implement could be achieved by the city council acting alone. For a discussion of that question, please see CRS Report RL33912, District of Columbia School Reform Proposal: Authority of the D.C. Council To Implement , by [author name scrubbed]. Instead of seeking passage of the Education Reform Act, the mayor could seek a congressional sponsor to introduce legislation that would amend the city's home rule charter. The procedure for such legislation would be as follows. A proposal originating in Congress to implement the Education Reform Act would not necessarily result in an expedited process. The controversial nature of the proposal could subject it to the regular legislative process, including hearings, markups, committee reports, House and Senate votes, and a conference agreement. The approved proposal could look significantly different from the proposal introduced on behalf of the mayor. Congress has initiated efforts to implement education reform previously. In 1995, Congress amended the home rule charter when it passed the District of Columbia School Reform Act, which was included as Title II of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, P.L. 104-134 . Title II authorized the creation of public charter schools in the District. In 2004, Congress considered and passed legislation amending the home rule charter when it included the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004, P.L. 108-199 . The DC School Choice Incentive Act created the private school voucher program. It should be noted that both of these programs were included as titles in District of Columbia appropriations acts. Although the city council may possess the authority to substantially reorganize public education in the District on its own, and Congress may also pass legislation without mayoral or city council review or approval, it is worth noting that the District's home rule charter includes provisions that would allow elements of the proposal that would amendment the District's home rule charter to be subject to a referendum vote. The Education Reform Act does not contemplate the use of the referendum process to ratify the proposed changes to the home rule charter. During community meetings held throughout the city to explain the proposal, a number of District residents voiced concern that the proposal was not being put to a referendum vote. Table 2, Charter Amendment by Referendum, outlines the legislative process to be followed when seeking to amend the Home Rule Act by referendum. This process would require the approval of the city council, ratification by the voters, and congressional review. The mayor's Education Reform Act does not contemplate the use of the referendum process. If the charter amendment by referendum process was used, the Home Rule Act would require city council and voter approval of the proposal and would allow a period for congressional review and consideration. Congress would have four options: It could pass a resolution of disapproval within 35 legislative days of the Board of Election and Ethics certifying that the proposed charter amendment had been approved by a majority of the voting electorate. Such a resolution would have the effect of voiding the outcome of the referendum and could be considered by some observers as an affront to home rule, while others could point out that it is within Congress's constitutional authority. It might do nothing, allowing the 35 legislative days to pass. By its inaction, Congress would allow the outcome of the referendum to take effect. It could pass legislation waiving the 35 legislative days review period, thus expediting the effective date of the charter amendment. Congress passed such a waiver in 2000, after voters approved, by referendum, an amendment to the home rule charter governing the composition of the Board of Education. It could use the appropriations process to demonstrate its opposition to measures approved by the city council and the citizens of the District if it were unable to pass a resolution of disapproval during the 35-day congressional review period. For instance, Congress has included in general provisions sections of past District of Columbia appropriation acts language preventing the District from implementing a voter-approved medical marijuana initiative.", "completion": "response:\nOn January 5, 2007, the newly elected mayor of the District of Columbia, Adrian Fenty, released his legislative proposal to transfer administrative and budgetary control of the District's public schools from the Board of Education to the Office of the Mayor.

To the extent that Congress sought to legislate beyond these two issues, it could pass legislation implementing any or all other aspects of the proposed act itself. This report will examine that option."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nPrior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), the amount that a debtor in bankruptcy could exempt as equity in a homestead was generally limited by two factors: (1) whether the domiciliary state allowed the debtor to choose between the federal and state exemptions and (2) the amount the domiciliary state allowed as an homestead exemption. A third factor was added by BAPCPA in cases in which a debtor had purchased the property within approximately three years and four months before filing a petition for bankruptcy. Additionally, BAPCPA restricts debtors' options for determining their domiciliary state and, thus, the state exemptions that will apply. Prior to BAPCPA, an individual anticipating filing for bankruptcy protection might, shortly before filing for bankruptcy, move to a state whose exemptions were more favorable than those in the state where the individual was currently living and benefit from the more favorable exemption amounts. This report discusses the federal homestead exemption, the effect BAPCPA has on a debtor's homestead exemption and, in Table 1 , provides a survey of the current homestead exemptions in the fifty states and the District of Columbia. The table also indicates whether state residents may choose between the state and federal exemptions. Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code addresses the extent to which an individual debtor may elect to exempt equity in certain property from becoming part of the bankruptcy estate. Property exempted from the bankruptcy estate is not available to satisfy creditors. Among the exemptions explicitly provided in the Bankruptcy Code—the federal exemptions—are a homestead exemption in the amount of $21,625 and a \"wildcard\" exemption of $1,150 that can also be applied to the homestead if the debtor chooses so long as the federal exemptions are available to the debtor. To the extent allowed under state law, the Bankruptcy Code allows debtors to choose between using the federal exemptions or those available under applicable state law. This is an \"either/or\" choice—debtors are not allowed to choose to use some state exemptions and some federal exemptions. When a petition is filed jointly by husband and wife or where the individual cases of a husband and wife are ordered to be jointly administered, each spouse must choose the same set of exemptions. However, debtors in many states have no choice to make because their state law prohibits the use of the federal exemptions. These federal exemptions are available to debtors only to the extent they are not prohibited by the applicable state. Nonetheless, while the homestead exemption in many states is greater than the federal homestead exemption, provisions were introduced in BAPCPA that impose limitations on the extent to which debtors can avail themselves of a state's homestead exemption. BAPCPA established a maximum homestead exemption for all debtors in all states unless a minimum period for property ownership was met. Subsection 522(p) of the Bankruptcy Code generally prohibits exempting an equity interest in the property that was acquired by the debtor during the 1215-day period immediately preceding the bankruptcy filing to the extent that the interest exceeds $146,450 in value. This limit may also apply in some cases in which the debtor has been convicted of a felony or has a debt resulting from violations of securities laws, fraud in a fiduciary capacity, or as the result of certain acts that caused serious physical injury or death. Additionally, if any part of the debtor's value in the residence is attributable to property disposed of in the 10-year period preceding the bankruptcy, the debtor's value in the residence must be reduced if all or part of the value in the previously owned property could not have been exempted in bankruptcy if the property were still owned when the debtor filed for bankruptcy. BAPCPA also restricts debtors' options for determining their domiciliary state, which may effectively place limits on their homestead exemption. Debtors must have lived in their current state for at least two years before they are eligible for that state's exemptions. Debtors who have not lived in the same state for at least two years prior to filing for bankruptcy must look back at where they lived for the 180-day period immediately preceding that two years. If the debtor lived in more than one state during that 180-day period, the domiciliary state is the one in which the debtor lived for the greater part of that 180-day period. Thus, through the changes made to § 522, BAPCPA limits the extent to which a debtor might plan for bankruptcy and maximize exempt assets. To effectively choose which state's exemptions will apply, a debtor must move to the chosen state approximately two years before filing for bankruptcy. To plan for a homestead exemption of more than $146,450, the debtor must acquire the interest approximately three years and four months before filing a bankruptcy petition. State laws were reviewed on both the Westlaw and LEXIS computer databases. In the table, the entry for each state first provides a brief synopsis of the homestead exemption available to debtors in bankruptcy as well as the extent to which debtors may elect to use federal rather than state exemptions. In some cases, de minimis \"wildcard\" exemptions that may be used for either real or personal property are noted, but the survey is not comprehensive with respect to them. They are more likely to be noted when a state has an extremely limited homestead exemption. Relevant excerpts of the state's statutory language is provided after the synopsis. Except as it is included in the excerpted statutory language, the survey does not address whether there is an exemption for proceeds after the sale of a homestead, nor does it address exemptions established by case law for homesteads held as tenancies by the entirety. Except as noted, state law provisions that constitute exceptions to the homestead exemption are not included in the survey.", "completion": "response:\nWhen debtors file for bankruptcy protection under Title 11 of the U.S. Code, they may exempt the value of certain property; in many cases, this includes their homestead. In practical terms, to the extent that the property's value does not exceed the allowed exemption amount, the debtor may keep the property rather than its becoming part of the bankruptcy estate and thereby being available to satisfy creditors. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) introduced additional limitations on the extent to which debtors could exempt value in their residences when filing for bankruptcy protection. This report surveys the homestead exemption laws of the 50 states and the District of Columbia with an emphasis on the amount of the exemptions and the extent to which debtors may choose between federal and state exemptions. It also describes the limitations on state homestead exemptions in 11 U.S.C. § 522(o)-(q) that were imposed by BAPCPA. The amounts states allow debtors to exempt in bankruptcy run the gamut. A few states (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) have no specific homestead exemption. Several jurisdictions allow debtors to exempt unlimited value in their homestead (the District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas), but some states allow an unlimited homestead exemption only in specific circumstances (Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, and Washington). In states with a specific dollar amount that is allowed as a homestead exemption, the majority of states allow an exemption that is more than $10,000, but less than $200,000. However, more than 10% of the states with a limited homestead exemption allow no more than $10,000. Only 10% allow $200,000 or more without imposing restrictions not related to residency. In some states, the amount of the available exemption is dependent upon age or disability. In others, marital status affects the available exemption. Some allow additional exemption amounts if there are dependent children in the home. In a few states, the exemption is lower for a mobile home than for a residence that is real property. In New York, the maximum available exemption is determined by the county in which the homestead is located. Massachusetts recently changed its laws to create two classes of homestead exemption—an automatic homestead exemption and a declared homestead exemption. The declared homestead exemption requires written formalities and is of greater maximum value than is the automatic exemption. Some states appear to use their homestead exemptions to address issues not directly related to the home. West Virginia generally allows debtors to exempt up to $25,000. That amount increases to $250,000 if the debtor is a physician with malpractice insurance coverage for at least $1 million per occurrence and the bankruptcy is, at least in part, a response to a medical malpractice verdict or judgment. Washington State generally limits debtors to exempting $125,000 for their homestead; however, if another state has gotten a judgment against the debtor for income taxes due to that other state on retirement benefits that were paid to the debtor while the debtor was a resident of Washington, the homestead exemption is unlimited.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nAll unemployment benefits including regular state Unemployment Compensation (UC), extended benefits (EB), Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA), and railroad unemployment benefits are potentially subject to the federal income tax. For income tax purposes, all temporary benefits, such as the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) benefits, are also included within this category. This tax treatment, which has been in place since 1987, puts all unemployment benefits on an equal basis with wages and other ordinary income with regard to income taxation. Unemployment benefits are not subject to employment taxes, including Social Security and Medicare taxes, because the benefits are not considered to be wages. In addition to being subject to federal income taxes, in most states that have an income tax, unemployment benefits are taxed. Most other industrial nations also tax unemployment benefits. State UC agencies must give UC beneficiaries the opportunity to elect federal income tax withholding at the time the claimant first files for UC benefits. Benefit claimants wishing to have federal income tax withheld from their UC benefits must file form W-4V, Voluntary Withholding Request . The current withholding rate for federal income tax is 10% of the gross UC benefits payment. Federal law does not require that states offer state income tax withholding to UC beneficiaries, although many do offer such services. Beneficiaries may opt to pay quarterly estimated taxes if a state does not offer state income tax withholding. Table 1 shows the number of federal income tax returns that reported unemployment benefits and the amount of unemployment benefits for tax years 1998 through 2013. The increases in the number of tax returns claiming unemployment benefits as income filed in 2001 through 2003 are attributable to the 2001 economic recession and the policy responses, including the temporary extension of unemployment benefits (the Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, TEUC) and providing additional benefits for individuals affected by the 2001 terrorist attack. The most recent recession that began in December 2007 is reflected in the sharp increases in 2008 and 2009 tax returns with an estimated additional 3.7 million tax returns claiming unemployment benefits as income in 2009 as compared with tax filings for 2007. This increase was attributable to higher levels of unemployment as well as the availability of additional weeks of unemployment benefits via the temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation program (EUC08, P.L. 110-252 , as amended). For tax year 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 §1007) excluded the first $2,400 from income taxes. Thus, the number of persons who had reportable unemployment insurance income was less than it would have otherwise been. This meant that the amount of unemployment benefits reported as income for tax purposes in 2009 was less than it would have otherwise been under the permanent law income tax treatment of unemployment compensation. The difference in the number of taxpayers reporting UC income in tax year 2010 as compared with 2009 was large, with an additional 3.6 million returns in 2010. The difference in returns was attributable to both the increase of potential weeks of EUC08 benefits available in 2010 ( P.L. 111-92 , enacted in November 2009) and the termination of the exclusion of the first $2,400 of UC income from income tax calculations. Nationally, the number of unemployed persons began to decrease in 2011 and as a result this triggered a decrease in the number of weeks available for some extended unemployment benefits (EB and EUC08) as both programs incorporated automatic reduction mechanisms based upon unemployment rates. These reductions in the number of persons receiving benefits and the potential number of weeks of unemployment benefits were reflected in the decreased number of returns reporting unemployment benefits as well as reported amount. By 2013, the number of returns containing UC income had decreased to 9.3 million, the lowest level since 2007. Typically, the loss of a job, even with unemployment benefits, results in a decline in earned income and often in total income. Unemployment benefits are not considered earned income for purposes of computing the earned income tax credit, and the earned income tax credit is not available if adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds a certain level or if investment income (interest, dividends, and capital gains distributions) exceeds a certain level. Table 2 shows the most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates of the effect of taxing unemployment compensation at various income levels. Families that reported an income of less than $10,000 in 2005 received an estimated $1.8 billion in UC benefits but only paid $6 million in taxes on those benefits. In comparison, families reporting an income between $50,000 and $100,000 received an estimated $7.3 billion in unemployment benefits and paid $1.2 billion in taxes on those benefits. Before 1979, UC benefits were not subject to the federal income tax. In the Revenue Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-600 ), UC benefits were made partially taxable for benefits received after December 31, 1978. Benefits were taxable only for tax filers whose AGI exceeded $20,000 (single filers) or $25,000 (joint filers). Taxation was applied to the lesser of (1) UC benefits or (2) one-half of AGI (with UC benefits included) in excess of the above-mentioned AGI thresholds. During the 1970s, some policy studies had shown that the proportion of wages replaced by UC benefits on an after-tax basis was large enough to erode a claimant's work incentive. Taxation of UC benefits served to reduce the degree of after-tax wage replacement and reduce the work disincentive effect. However, UC benefits of lower-income claimants remained untaxed because their total income was under the tax threshold (i.e., their standard deduction and personal exemptions offset their income). In 1982, Congress lowered the AGI thresholds for taxation of UC benefits. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-248 ) reduced those thresholds to $12,000 for single filers and $18,000 for joint filers. A primary motivation of this legislation was to raise revenue, but it left in place a policy of protecting lower-income claimants from taxation of UC benefits. Congress made UC benefits fully taxable in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ), effective for benefits received after December 31, 1986. Although this action reversed the original policy of taxing UC benefits only above an AGI threshold, it occurred in the context of a law that removed many low-income filers from the tax rolls, lowered the marginal tax rates for the majority of taxpayers, and expanded eligibility for the earned income credit. The rationale for full taxation of UC benefits was to treat UC benefits the same as wages and to eliminate the work disincentive caused by favorable tax treatment for UC benefits relative to wages. Concern about claimants' cash flow problems caused by the lack of tax withholding from UC benefits arose during the 1990-1991 recession. P.L. 102-318 required states to inform all new claimants of their responsibility to pay income tax on UC benefits and to provide them with information on how to file estimated quarterly tax payments. In 1994, P.L. 103-465 required states to withhold federal income tax from UC benefits if a claimant requested withholding, and permitted states to withhold state and local income taxes. P.L. 103-465 set the federal withholding rate at 15% of the gross benefit payment amount. The federal withholding rate was changed to 10% by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16 ) effective August 7, 2001. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 §1007) included a temporary exclusion on the first $2,400 of UC benefits for the purposes of the federal income tax. This exclusion applied only for the 2009 tax year. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that this exclusion would reduce federal receipts by approximately $4.7 billion. As of the date of this report, no relevant legislation in the current Congress has been introduced.", "completion": "response:\nUnemployment compensation (UC) benefits have been fully subject to the federal income tax since the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514).

In some instances, the President makes these appointments using authorities granted by law to the President alone. Other appointments are made with the advice and consent of the Senate via the nomination and confirmation of appointees. Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation are often referred to with the abbreviation PAS. This report identifies, for the 114 th Congress, all nominations to full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation in 40 organizations in the executive branch (27 independent agencies, 6 agencies in the Executive Office of the President [EOP], and 7 multilateral organizations) and 4 agencies in the legislative branch. It excludes appointments to executive departments and to regulatory and other boards and commissions, which are covered in other Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports.

Related CRS reports regarding the presidential appointments process, nomination activity for other executive branch positions, recess appointments, and other appointment-related matters may be found at http://www.crs.gov . During the 114 th Congress, President Barack Obama submitted 43 nominations to the Senate for full-time positions in independent agencies, agencies in the EOP, multilateral agencies, and legislative branch agencies. Of these nominations, 22 were confirmed, 16 were returned to the President, and 5 were withdrawn. Table 1 summarizes the appointment activity. The length of time a given nomination may be pending in the Senate varies widely. Some nominations are confirmed within a few days, others are not confirmed for several months, and some are never confirmed. This report provides, for each agency nomination confirmed in the 114 th Congress, the number of days between nomination and confirmation (\"days to confirm\"). Under Senate Rules, nominations not acted on by the Senate at the end of a session of Congress (or before a recess of 30 days) are returned to the President. The Senate, by unanimous consent, often waives this rule—although not always. In the case of nominations that are returned to the President and resubmitted, this report measures the days to confirm from the date of receipt of the resubmitted nomination, not the original. For agency nominations confirmed in the 114 th Congress, a mean of 174.1 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 152.0. Agency profiles in this report are organized in two parts. The first table lists the titles and pay levels of all the agency's full-time PAS positions as of the end of the 114 th Congress. For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule. As of the end of the 114 th Congress, these pay levels range from level I ($205,700) for Cabinet-level offices to level V ($150,200) for lower-ranked positions. The second table lists appointment action for vacant positions during the 114 th Congress in chronological order. This table provides the name of the nominee, position title, date of nomination or appointment, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation, and notes relevant actions other than confirmation (e.g., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President). When more than one nominee has had appointment action, the second table also provides statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. The average days to confirm are provided in two ways: mean and median. The mean is a more familiar measure, though it may be influenced by outliers in the data. The median, by contrast, does not tend to be influenced by outliers. In other words, a nomination that took an extraordinarily long time to be confirmed might cause a significant change in the mean, but the median would be unaffected. Examining both numbers offers more information with which to assess the central tendency of the data. Appendix A provides two tables. Table A-1 relists all appointment action identified in this report and is organized alphabetically by the appointee's last name. Table entries identify the agency to which each individual was appointed, position title, nomination date, date confirmed or other final action, and duration count for confirmed nominations. In the final two rows, the table includes the mean and median values for the \"days to confirm\" column. Table A-2 provides summary data from the appointments identified in this report and is organized by agency type, including independent executive agencies, agencies in the EOP, multilateral organizations, and agencies in the legislative branch. The table summarizes the number of positions, nominations submitted, individual nominees, confirmations, nominations returned, and nominations withdrawn for each agency grouping.

Following the attacks, both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage. Because insurance is required for a variety of economic transactions, particularly borrowing for commercial development, many feared that a lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have a wider economic impact. Congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA). TRIA created a temporary, three-year terrorism insurance program to calm the insurance markets through a government reinsurance backstop sharing in terrorism losses. The idea was to give the private industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk. TRIA requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage but does not require commercial policyholders to purchase the coverage. Congress extended the program in 2005 and 2007. In 2005, the extension legislation focused on reducing the government's exposure from TRIA by increasing the minimum covered event size, raising the insurer deductible, reducing the government share of losses, and increasing the post-event mandatory recoupment. In 2007, the primary change was to accelerate the after-the-fact recoupment. Although the prospective government share of losses has been reduced over time, the 2007 reauthorization also expanded the program to cover losses from acts of domestic terrorism. Both the House and the Senate passed different TRIA extension bills in the 113 th Congress, but final legislation was not enacted. Thus, the TRIA program expired at the end of 2014, as provided for in the 2007 extension. The initial thresholds of the program when it expired were as follows: 1. A terrorist act must have caused $5 million in insured losses to be certified for TRIA coverage. 2. The aggregate insured losses from a certified act of terrorism must have been $100 million in a year for government coverage to begin. 3. An individual insurer must have met a deductible of 20% of its annual premiums for government coverage to begin. Once these thresholds were met, the government would have covered 85% of insured losses due to terrorism, with the private insurers retaining 15% of the losses. The government did not charge premiums for this coverage. Instead, if the insured losses were under $27.5 billion, the Secretary of the Treasury was required to recoup 133% of government outlays through a surcharge on commercial property/casualty insurance policies. If insured losses rose above $27.5 billion, the Secretary was required to recoup a reduced amount of the outlays. At some high insured loss level, which depended on the exact distribution of losses, the Secretary no longer was required to recoup outlays but retained the discretionary authority to do so. Under the law when it expired, all mandatory recoupment was required to be completed by the end of FY2017. Since TRIA's passage, private industry's willingness and ability to cover terrorism risk have increased. According to industry surveys, prices for terrorism coverage have generally trended downward and approximately 60% of commercial policyholders have purchased coverage over the past few years. The price drops and coverage increases, however, occurred under the umbrella of TRIA coverage, and it is unclear how the insurance market would have reacted to a lasting expiration of the federal program. Representative Randy Neugebauer introduced H.R. 26 on January 6, 2015, and the House passed the bill by a vote of 416-5 with one Member voting present on January 7, 2015. The Senate passed the bill on January 8, 2015, on a vote of 93-4 and the President signed P.L. 114-1 on January 12, 2015. The language of H.R. 26 / P.L. 114-1 is identical aside from technical corrections to that of the amended version of the 113 th Congress bill, S. 2244 , which passed the House on December 10, 2014. P.L. 114-1 includes provisions to extend the TRIA program nearly six years, until the end of 2020; decrease the federal loss sharing gradually from 85% to 80%; increase the program trigger by $20 million per year until it reaches $200 million from $100 million in 2015; increase the insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount by $2 billion per year until it reaches $37.5 billion from the $27.5 billion. After it reaches $37.5 billion, the amount is to be set by the Secretary of the Treasury to equal the annual average of aggregate insurer deductibles for the previous three years; extend the various dates for mandatory recoupment by seven years; change the mandatory recoupment provisions to require that 140% of the federal payments be recouped; require the Treasury to study the certification process and issue final rules governing the process, including a timeline; require the Treasury to collect additional data on the terrorism insurance market and include that data in an annual report; and require a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the possible effects of instituting insurer premiums for TRIA coverage and requiring capital reserve funds for terrorism. In addition to the TRIA provisions, P.L. 114-1 also includes a Title II relating to insurance agent licensing, a section relating to the makeup of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and a Title III amending statutory provisions originating in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to derivatives and margin requirements for end users. Similar provisions to Title II and Title III passed the House in the 113 th Congress. Table 1 below presents a side-by-side analysis of the TRIA law as it existed upon expiration and P.L. 114-1 . A side-by-side comparison of legislation in the 113 th Congress can be found in the Appendix .", "completion": "response:\nPrior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, insurance covering terrorism losses was normally included in commercial insurance policies without additional cost to the policyholders. Following the attacks, this ceased to be the case as insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage. Some feared that a lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have a wide economic impact, particularly because insurance coverage can be a significant factor in lending decisions. Congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA; P.L. 107-297). TRIA created a temporary program, expiring at the end of 2005, to calm the insurance markets through a government reinsurance program sharing in terrorism losses. This program was intended to give the industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk. TRIA did not require premiums to be paid for the government coverage. Instead, it required private insurers to offer commercial insurance for terrorism risk, with the government then recouping some or all federal payments under the act in the years following government coverage of insurer losses. Under TRIA, terrorism insurance became widely available and largely affordable and the insurance industry greatly expanded its financial capacity. There has been, however, little apparent success in developing a longer-term private solution, and fears have persisted about the economic consequences if terrorism insurance were not available. Congress passed two extensions to the program, one in 2005 (P.L. 109-144) and one in 2007 (P.L. 110-160). The 2005 extension primarily focused on reducing the government's up-front financial exposure under the act, whereas the 2007 extension left most of the up-front aspect of the TRIA program unchanged but accelerated the post-event recoupment provisions. The 2007 legislation also included the only expansion of the TRIA program since initial enactment; it extended the program to cover any acts of terrorism, as opposed to only foreign acts of terrorism. In the 113th Congress, both the House and the Senate passed legislation that would have extended TRIA, but differences between the bills prevented enactment. The 113th Congress adjourned without extending the program. Thus, per P.L. 110-160, the TRIA program expired at the end of 2014. Although insurance industry capacity has increased since 2002, many still see terrorism as essentially uninsurable. Without TRIA, the insurance industry indicated that terrorism insurance would again become unavailable or unaffordable. Fears were again being expressed that a lack of terrorism insurance may slow down other sectors of the economy. In the 114th Congress, both the House and the Senate passed the same bill, H.R. 26, and the President signed P.L. 114-1 on January 12, 2015. H.R. 26/P.L. 114-1 extends the program nearly six years while reducing the government's share of the losses compared with the program as it was in 2014. Specifically, P.L. 114-1 gradually (1) increases the program trigger from $100 million to $200 million, (2) reduces the government share of the losses from 85% to 80%, and (3) increases the mandatory recoupment amount to $37.5 billion. This report briefly outlines the issues involved with terrorism insurance, summarizes extension legislation, and includes a side-by-side comparison of TRIA law and the bills introduced in the 114th and 113th Congresses.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nIndividuals were first able to establish health savings accounts (HSAs) in 2004. These accounts allow people to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses on a tax-advantaged basis. Individuals must have a qualifying high-deductible health plan (HDHP) to establish an HSA. After establishing an HSA, individuals (or employers) can contribute money to the account up to an annual maximum. Although commonly discussed in combination, HSAs should not be confused with Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs). Even though HRAs are also used to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses on a tax-advantaged basis, only employers may establish and contribute to an HRA. In addition, employees usually forfeit any remaining HRA funds at the termination of employment. Data covering enrollment and/or cost sharing during the first few years of HDHPs and their associated HSAs are now available from at least five separate sources. Only one source provides data on HSAs. Two sources provide data on HDHPs whose owners are eligible to open an HSA. The remaining two sources provide data that include individuals with HRAs. Before analysts can evaluate the effects of HSAs, they must decide which data source(s) to use. This primer provides basic guidance in that direction. The primer also provides the most recent data available from each source on enrollment, premiums, and deductible. Table 1 identifies the five data sources. The various data sources include two separate surveys of firms, a survey of individuals, data on all policies reported to an association, and a sample of IRS tax returns. The data sources are listed in alphabetical order. Which data source to use depends primarily on the question being asked. If the policy question truly requires information on HSAs—that is, the actual accounts rather than the associated HDHPs—then only the IRS data are suitable. The IRS data, which are broken down by tax reporting units, provide the total number of tax deductions taken and the aggregate value of the deductions. Two disadvantages of the IRS data are a total lack of information on the associated HDHPs and that the data are released well after the other data sources. Two sources combine data on HSA-eligible HDHPs and HRAs. These data can be used if separate analyses of HSAs or HRAs are not necessary. The Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) provides enrollment estimates for privately insured individuals aged 21 to 64 with either an HRA or an HSA-eligible HDHP, while Mercer, a human resources consulting firm, provides enrollment estimates for account holders who are adults working in firms with at least 10 employees with either an HRA or an HSA-eligible HDHP. The EBRI data are based on a survey of individuals and contain information on the workers' ages, incomes, health status, and opinions of their health plan options. The Mercer survey is of firms and contains information on firm size. Choosing between these two data sources comes down to a choice between an individual-level analysis (EBRI) or a firm-level analysis (Mercer). Finally, two additional data sources provide information on HSA-qualified HDHPs. The data from America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) are obtained from insurance plans and measure all covered lives in the plans. Both individual and group plans are analyzed. The data form virtually a census of such policies among AHIP member companies. Thus, the AHIP data are based on a large number of enrollees in high-deductible health plans. Along with the average premiums and deductibles, information on enrollees' age and state of residence is also available. The Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust (KFF/HRET) survey is of firms with at least three employees. Table 2 presents the most recent available data on enrollment. Four of the sources contain data on enrollment. The enrollment estimates differ greatly. These differences occur because each source measures a unique concept. AHIP reports that 10,009,000 individuals (including children) were covered by an HSA-eligible HDHP, and EBRI reports that 11,200,000 individuals between 21 and 64 were enrolled in either an HSA-eligible HDHP or an HRA in 2009. Mercer reports that 9% of all covered employees (in firms with at least 10 employees) have either an HSA-eligible HDHP or HRA, also in 2009. The IRS data do not measure enrollment but state that 810,729 tax returns claimed an HSA deduction in 2008. Although the various enrollment measures are not directly comparable to each other because they represent different concepts, the number of individuals who claim deductions for HSA contributions in 2008 is the smallest number. This is as expected for two reasons: (1) the number of HSAs has been growing over the 2008 to 2010 period, and (2) not all individuals contribute money to the HSA—and of those who do, not all claim an HSA deduction. AHIP provides the most complete information on premiums and deductibles; the average values are available for the small group and large group markets, and for three age groups in the individual market. No other data source provides breakdowns for more than one of these markets. In all cases, values for individual (and not family) insurance plans are reported in Table 2 . In general, individuals in small group markets are more costly to insure because the risk of major illness is spread across fewer individuals and because there are fewer economies of scale. Small group market deductibles should therefore be higher than large group market deductibles, assuming benefits and other policy characteristics are comparable across group size. The AHIP data display the expected pattern for HSA-eligible HDHPs, although the difference is not particularly large. The average deductible for small group policies is $2,329, and the average deducible for a large group policy is $2,203. HSAs have been available since 2004, and at least five data sources can be used to uncover some basic facts about the recent experience. Nevertheless, the data sources differ in the insurance markets analyzed; whether the information covers HSAs, HSA-eligible HDHPs, or HSA-eligible HDHPs and HRAs; and whether the information is provided by employers, insurance companies, or individuals. Great caution should be exercised in any attempt to combine data from these different sources. A more fruitful strategy would be to decide on a specific question and use only the source which best answers that question.", "completion": "response:\nIndividuals began establishing health savings accounts (HSAs) in 2004.

This primer provides information on the data sources, together with the most recent data available from each source on enrollment, premiums and deductibles.

Notably, these issuances occurred following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which occurred back-to-back in the Gulf Coast region of the United States in late summer 2005; and as part of fulfilling OPM's responsibilities under the President's national strategy on pandemic influenza in 2006. Most recently, OPM issued guidance in a memorandum titled, \"Human Resources Flexibilities for Hurricane Harvey and its Aftermath,\" issued on August 27, 2017. The memorandum \"remind[s] agencies of the wide range of Human Resources (HR) policies and flexibilities currently available to assist Federal employees.\" On September 1, 2017, OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), established an emergency leave transfer program for federal employees who were adversely affected by Hurricane Harvey. Seven days later, on September 8, 2017, as Hurricane Irma tracked toward Florida, OPM authorized departments and agencies to hire individuals under excepted service appointments and on a temporary basis for up to one year (with an extension up to one year). The individuals \"will be directly involved with the recovery and relief efforts associated with Hurricane Harvey or Hurricane Irma.\" Subject to guidance from the OPM Director, Federal Executive Boards (FEBs) are available to assist the agency with matters related to emergency operations, such as operations under hazardous weather conditions. The FEBs were established by a presidential memorandum issued by President John F. Kennedy in November 1961, to \"provide means for closer coordination of Federal activities at the regional level.\" Currently, FEBs operate in 28 metropolitan areas. A goal of the FEBs is \"to create effective collaboration on emergency readiness and recovery, and to educate [the] Federal workforce on issues in emergency situations.\" Table 1 , below, provides information on selected flexibilities related to staffing, compensation, leave transfer, and telework in Title 5 of the United States Code and Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations . The table refers to several HR terms, which are explained as follows: Competitive s ervice positions are civil service positions in the executive branch, except positions which are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute; positions to which appointments are made by nomination for confirmation by the Senate, unless the Senate otherwise directs; and positions in the Senior Executive Service (SES). Such positions require applicants to compete against one another in open competition based on job-related criteria to obtain employment. The positions are subject to the civil service laws codified at Title 5 of the United States Code and to oversight by OPM. Employees are to be selected from among the best-qualified candidates and without discrimination. Excepted s ervice positions are civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the SES. Qualification standards and requirements for these positions are established by the individual agencies. The Title 5 rules on appointment (except for veterans' preference), pay, and classification do not apply. SES positions are classified above grade 15 of the General Schedule or in level IV or V of the Executive Schedule, or an equivalent position, and are not filled by presidential appointment by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Members of the SES, among other duties, direct the work of an organizational unit and exercise important policymaking, policy-determining, or other executive functions. The Reemployment Priority List is the mechanism agencies use to give reemployment consideration to their current and former competitive service employees who will be, or were, separated by reduction in force or who are fully recovered from a compensable injury after more than one year.", "completion": "response:\nFederal executive branch departments and agencies have available to them various human resources management flexibilities for emergency situations involving severe weather, natural disaster, and other circumstances. At various times, the Office of Personnel Management issued guidance on these flexibilities, which supplements the basic policies governing staffing, compensation, leave sharing, and telework in Title 5 of the United States Code and Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Some examples of when issuances have occurred include following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005; in response to pandemic influenza in 2006; and in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017."}

Under section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), an eligible taxpayer may exclude fromgross incomeup to $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing jointly) of the gain realized from the sale of his or her principal residence. One eligibilityrequirement is that the taxpayer must have used the property as a principal residence for at least two of the five yearspreceding thedate of sale. The Act amends section 121 so that a taxpayer may elect to suspend the five-year period for up to tenyears during thetime that the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse is on qualified official extended duty. (1) Qualified duty is serving for more than 90days or an indefinite period at a duty station that is at least 50 miles from the residence or while residing underorders in Governmentquarters. The new rule applies to sales and exchanges made after May 6, 1997. Since taxpayers are generally unableto amendreturns more than three years after the original filing date or two years after the tax was paid, (2) the Act grants taxpayers one year tofile for a refund even though it may otherwise be barred. The one-year period began on November 11, 2003. Exclusion of the military death benefit from gross income (sec. 102). Under IRC� 134, qualified military benefits are excluded from gross income. The exclusion is limited to benefits that (1) aremade on accountof the taxpayer's status or service as a member of the Armed Forces and (2) were excusable on September 9, 1986. Any benefitincrease after September 9, 1986 is included in income, unless it is a cost-of-living adjustment or similar increase. The death gratuitypayment made to the survivors of members of the Armed Forces who die while on active duty is a qualified militarybenefit. (3) Thepayment was $3,000 on September 9, 1986 and it was later increased to $6,000. Thus, prior to the Act, the $3,000increase wasincluded in income. The Act makes two changes related to the death gratuity payment. First, the benefit is increased from $6,000 to $12,000. Second,the entire payment, including any future increases, is excluded from gross income. The changes apply for all deathsoccurring afterSeptember 10, 2001. Exclusion of payments made to offset the negative effect of base closure on housing values (sec.103). Under the Homeowners Assistance Program found in 42 U.S.C. � 3374, the Department of Defensemay offerpayments to members of the Armed Forces whose housing values have decreased due to military base realignmentor closure. Priorto the Act, such payments did not qualify for exclusion from gross income. The Act amends IRC � 132 so thatpayments made afterNovember 11, 2003 are nontaxable fringe benefits, subject to limitation by 42 U.S.C. � 3374(c). Expanded eligibility for tax-related deadline extensions (sec. 104). Under IRC �7508(a), individuals serving in a Presidentially-declared combat zone are allowed extra time to complete a varietyof tax-relatedactivities, including filing returns and paying taxes. The Act expands the group of taxpayers eligible for theextensions to individualsserving in a contingency operation as determined under 10 U.S.C. � 101(a)(13). Examples of contingency operationsincludeoperations where members of the Armed Forces are or may become involved in hostilities against a foreign enemyand operationsduring national emergencies that require the call up of members of the Armed Forces. The new rule applies for anyperiod forperforming an act that did not expire before November 11, 2003. Expanded eligibility for tax-exempt status for military organizations (sec. 105). Under IRC � 501, military organizations may qualify for tax-exempt status if (1) at least 75% of the members arepast or presentmembers of the Armed Forces and (2) substantially all of the other members are cadets or spouses, widows, orwidowers of past orpresent members of the Armed Forces or of cadets. The Act eases the \"substantially all\" requirement by allowingancestors or linealdescendants of past or present members of the Armed Forces or of cadets to be included. The change applies totaxable years afterNovember 11, 2003. Clarification of treatment of dependent care assistance programs (sec.106). Thetax treatment of payments made to members of the Armed Forces under dependent care assistance programs hasbeen unclear. TheAct amends IRC � 134 to make it clear that these payments are subject to exclusion as a qualified military benefit. Thus, if apayment meets the qualifications in section 134, it may be excluded from income. The change applies for taxableyears afterDecember 31, 2002. Tax favored status for distributions to military academy attendees from education savings accounts(sec. 107). Under IRC � 530(d), a portion of a distribution made from a Coverdell education savingsaccount thatexceeds the taxpayer's educational expenses is included in gross income and penalized by an additional tax. TheAct exemptsdistributions made to attendees of military academies from the additional tax. The exemption is limited to theattendee's \"advancededucation costs\" that are described in 10 U.S.C. � 2005(e)(3). The change applies for taxable years after December31, 2002. Deduction for overnight travel expenses of National Guard and Reserve members (sec.109). Prior to the Act, overnight travel expenses of National Guard and Reserve members weredeductible only bytaxpayers who itemized their deductions, subject to the limitation on miscellaneous itemized deductions. The Actcreates anabove-the-line deduction for these expenses. The expenses are limited to the general Federal per diem rate and mustbe incurredwhile the reservist is serving more than 100 miles from home. (4) The change applies to expenses paid or incurred after December 31,2002. Suspension of tax-exempt status for terrorist organizations (sec. 108). The Actsuspends the tax-exempt status or the application for such status for any organization that is either (1) designateda terroristorganization by executive order or under authority found in the Immigration and Nationality Act, the InternationalEmergencyEconomic Powers Act, or the United Nations Participation Act or (2) designated by executive order as supportingterrorism orengaging in terrorist activity. No deduction is allowed for any contribution to the organization during thesuspension. Thesuspension lasts until the designation is rescinded under the authority by which it was made. No challenges to thesuspension,designation, or denial of a deduction are allowed in any proceeding concerning the tax liability of the organizationor anothertaxpayer. The new rules apply to all designations, whether made before, on or after November 11, 2003. Tax relief for astronauts killed in the line of duty (sec. 110). The Act provides taxrelief to astronauts who die in the line of duty after December 31, 2002. (5) First, astronauts are not subject to the income tax in theyear of death and in earlier years beginning with the taxable year prior to that in which the mortal injury occurred. (6) If the taxliability for those years, disregarding the exemption, is less than $10,000, then the taxpayer is treated as having madea tax paymentin the final taxable year that is equal to $10,000 less the liability. Further, the Act excludes employee death benefitpayments fromthe astronaut's income (7) and applies reduced estatetax rates to the astronaut's estate. (8) Extension of customs user fees (sec. 201). The authorization for the customs userfees found in 19 U.S.C. � 58c(j)(3) is extended from March 31, 2004 to March 1, 2005.", "completion": "response:\nThe Military Family Tax Relief Act of 2003, H.R. 3365, became P.L.108-121 on November 11, 2003.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nSection 1811 of the Social Security Act provides that Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries are eligible for Medicare hospital insurance (Part A). Individuals are also eligible to purchase Medicare supplementary medical insurance (Part B) or enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan (formerly known as a Medicare+Choice plan). SSDI beneficiaries are also eligible for voluntary prescription drug benefits (Part D). Generally, SSDI beneficiaries under age 65 are eligible for Medicare coverage in the month after they have received 24 months of SSDI benefits. Because of the five-month waiting period from onset of the disabling condition for disabled individuals to be qualified to receive SSDI benefits, this results in a total of 29 months after the onset of the disability before an individual is eligible for Medicare benefits. Thus, at the beginning of the 30 th month since the onset of the qualifying disability, SSDI beneficiaries become eligible for Medicare coverage. For SSDI beneficiaries under 65 years of age, there are exceptions to the required 24-month waiting period for certain diseases. Specifically, SSDI beneficiaries qualify for Medicare after 24 months of receiving SSDI benefits (the general rule described previously); or at the first month of receiving SSDI benefits if the beneficiary has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease); or after the third month when a beneficiary has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or kidney failure; or in the month in which a beneficiary receives a kidney transplant. The ALS exception went into effect July 1, 2001 as a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, P.L. 106-554 . The ESRD provision was part of Social Security Amendments of 1972, P.L. 92-603. In addition to SSDI beneficiaries, other individuals who are under age 65 may be eligible for Medicare on account of a disabling condition as described below. Certain disabled local, state, and federal employees who do not receive SSDI benefits may be eligible after the waiting period. Disabled widows and widowers ages 50 to 65 (and disabled divorced widows and widowers ages 50 to 65) are eligible for Medicare after a 24-month qualifying period if they are receiving Social Security benefits based on disability. For disabled widows/widowers, previous months of eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) based on disability may count toward the qualifying period. Certain dependent adult children of Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for Medicare if they developed a permanent and severe disability before age 22 and thus qualify for SSDI benefits based on a parent's work history. The two-year waiting period applies and starts when an individual turns 18 or when he or she is determined to be disabled if it is after age 18. A spouse or child may be eligible for Medicare, based on a worker's record, if the spouse or child is on continuing dialysis for ESRD or has a kidney transplant, even if no other family member participates in the Medicare program. Table 1 shows the number and percentage of persons under 65 years old who received Medicare in July 2005 due to disabling conditions. In 2006, just over 7 million beneficiaries under the age of 65 received Medicare on account of disability status. More than 43% of disabled beneficiaries were between the ages 55 and 64. More men (53.3%) than women (46.7%) received this benefit and the vast majority (73.5%) were white. The Social Security Amendments of 1972, P.L. 92-603, extended Medicare to persons with disabilities who had been entitled to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits for at least 24 consecutive months. The provision required the waiting period to begin with the first month of SSDI entitlement, which is five months after the onset of the disability. In 1971, the House Committee on Ways and Means Report recommended extending Medicare protection to the disabled and stated that the Committee felt it was \"imperative to proceed on a conservative basis.\" The report stated that the 24-month waiting period was intended to ... help keep the costs within reasonable bounds, avoid overlapping private health insurance protection, particularly where a disabled worker may continue his membership in a group insurance plan for a period of time following the onset of his disability and minimize certain administrative problems that might otherwise arise.... Moreover, this approach provides assurance that the protection will be available to those whose disabilities have proven to be severe and long lasting. A similar statement was included in the report to the Senate from the Committee on Finance. The Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980, P.L. 96-265 , permitted an individual becoming re-entitled to SSDI benefits to count the months of the earlier spell of disability in satisfying the 24-month waiting period if the spell occurred within the previous five years or seven years for disabled widow(er)s and those who were disabled since childhood. The amendments also provided that if an individual was in a trial work period after the termination of the SSDI benefits, and had not completed the 24-month waiting period, the months of the trial work period could count toward satisfying the required waiting period for Medicare eligibility. Effective October 1, 2000, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, P.L. 106-170 , extended Medicare Part A coverage to certain working former SSDI beneficiaries for a total of 8.5 years. Those SSDI beneficiaries with limited incomes and assets may qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. Under SSI, disabled, blind, or aged individuals who have low incomes and limited resources are eligible for benefits regardless of their work histories. In most states SSI receipt will entitle a person to Medicaid benefits. Certain working SSDI beneficiaries who had been receiving Medicaid benefits may be eligible for a Buy-In Option allowing maintenance of Medicaid coverage. Thirty-two states currently provide a Medicaid Buy-In Option. Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), P.L. 99-272 , requires employers who offer health insurance to continue coverage for persons who would otherwise lose coverage due to a change in work or family status. Coverage generally lasts 18 months but, depending on the circumstances, can last for longer periods. If the Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a determination that the date of an individual's onset of disability occurred during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage or earlier, the employee and the employee's spouse and dependents are eligible for an additional 11 months of continuation coverage. This is a total of 29 months from the date of the qualifying termination or reduction of hours of employment. This provision was designed to provide a source of coverage while individuals wait for Medicare coverage to begin. Some SSDI beneficiaries may qualify for other government programs including veterans' programs for hospital and medical care. According to research based on new SSDI beneficiaries in 1995 who qualified upon their own work record, 11.8% died within the waiting period, 2.1% recovered, and 86.1% became entitled to Medicare. The study estimated hypothetical Medicare costs for the first 24 months of SSDI entitlement to be $10,055 in 2000 dollars per person. Costs varied substantially by diagnostic group and by whether the person died or recovered during the waiting period. On average, beneficiaries who died during the waiting period were estimated to cost $25,864, whereas those who recovered were estimated to cost $1,506. One research study suggested that eliminating the 24-month Medicare waiting period would cost $5.3 billion while another study estimated the cost at $8.7 billion. The differences in the estimates are because: (1) the $5.3 billion used 2000 dollars while the $8.7 billion is in 2002 dollars: (2) the $5.3 billion estimate is for only SSDI beneficiaries that qualified under their own work record while the $8.7 billion estimate includes disabled adult children and disabled widow(er)s; and (3) each used substantially different estimation methodologies. Neither of these estimates include the cost of the prescription drug benefit that started in January 2006. In 2002, approximately 40% of SSDI beneficiaries in the Medicare waiting period were enrolled in Medicaid. One study estimated that the federal government would save $2.5 billion in Medicaid if the 24-month waiting period was eliminated; however, these federal Medicaid savings would more than be offset by the aforementioned cost increases to the Medicare program. Additionally, the states would realize $1.8 billion in Medicaid savings if the waiting period was eliminated.", "completion": "response:\nRecipients of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits are eligible for Medicare benefits after a 24-month waiting period.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nLifeline is a federal program, established in 1984, that assists eligible individuals in paying the recurring monthly service charges associated with either wireline or wireless telephone usage. The program is part of the Low Income Program supported by the Universal Service Fund. Eligible households can receive up to $9.25 per month in Lifeline discounts. Additional state support may be available. Approximately 2,000 telephone companies are eligible to provide these discounts. A household applies for the discounts through their designated telecommunications service provider. Support is not given directly to the subscriber, but to the service provider. The provider is reimbursed through the Lifeline Program and in turn passes the discount on to the subscriber. The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), an independent not-for-profit organization, is the designated administrator of the Universal Service Fund (USF), of which the Lifeline Program is a part. USAC administers the USF programs for the Federal Communications Commission and does not set or advocate policy. The Lifeline program covers the minutes of use for the eligible subscriber. Depending on the package selected the subscriber is allocated a set number of usage minutes per month. Once the allocation is used the subscriber may choose to pay for additional minutes of use. Although not required, most providers that offer a prepaid wireless option provide a wireless phone to the subscriber for free. The cost of this phone is not covered under the Lifeline program but is borne by the designated provider. Although the prepaid wireless option is growing in popularity the Lifeline program also covers a wireline option or a postpaid wireless option. As with the case of the prepaid wireless option the program solely covers the minutes of use, not the device. The Lifeline program is available to eligible low-income consumers in every state, territory, and commonwealth, and on Tribal lands. To participate in the program, consumers must either have an income that is at or below 135% of the federal Poverty Guidelines or participate in one of the following assistance programs: Medicaid; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Food Stamps or SNAP); Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Federal Public Housing Assistance (Section 8); Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP); Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); National School Lunch Program's Free Lunch Program; Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance; Tribally-Administered Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TTANF); Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR); Head Start (if income eligibility criteria are met); or state assistance programs (if applicable). The Lifeline Pre-Screening Tool ( http://www.lifelinesupport.org/ls/eligibility/default.aspx ) provided by USAC can help determine whether a household is eligible for Lifeline assistance. At least once each year, beginning in 2012, consumers who are receiving lifeline service must recertify their eligibility and that no one else in their household has a lifeline discounted service. A failure to recertify eligibility will result in removal from the program. Consumers apply for Lifeline through their local telephone company or designated state agency. The Companies in My State ( http://www.lifelinesupport.org/ls/companies.aspx ) provided by USAC can help locate a Lifeline provider in your state. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) provides a listing and links to state utility commissions ( http://www.naruc.org/Commissions/CommissionsList.cfm ). Telecommunications carriers that provide interstate service and certain other providers of telecommunications services are required to contribute to the federal USF based on a percentage of their end-user interstate and international telecommunications revenues. These companies include wireline telephone companies, wireless telephone companies, paging service providers, and certain Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers. The USF receives no federal monies. Some consumers may notice a \"Universal Service\" line item on their telephone bills. This line item appears when a company chooses to recover its USF contributions directly from its customers by billing them this charge. The FCC permits, but does not require, this charge to be passed on directly to customers. Each company makes a business decision about whether and how to assess charges to recover its Universal Service obligations. The charge, however, cannot exceed the amount owed to the USF by the company. No. Federal rules prohibit eligible low-income consumers from receiving more than one Lifeline discount per household. An eligible consumer may receive a discount on either a wireline or wireless service, but not both. If a household is currently receiving more than one monthly Lifeline service, it must select one provider to provide Lifeline service and it must contact the other provider to de-enroll from their program. Subscribers found to be violating this rule will be de-enrolled and may also be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties.", "completion": "response:\nThe concept that all Americans should have affordable access to the telecommunications network, commonly called the \"universal service concept,\" can trace its origins back to the 1934 Communications Act. The preservation and advancement of universal service has remained a basic tenet of federal communications policy, and in the mid-1980s the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established the Lifeline program to provide support for low-income subscribers. The Lifeline program, which is administered under the Universal Service Fund (USF) Low Income Program, was established by the FCC in 1984 to assist eligible low-income subscribers to cover the recurring monthly service charges incurred for telephone usage. Although the program solely covers costs associated with the minutes of use, not the telephone, misinformation connecting the program to payment for a \"free phone\" has resulted in a significant number of constituent inquiries."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThis report provides overview information on the proposed FY2011 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) programs that provide assistance to state and local governments. These programs are primarily used by first responders, including firefighters, emergency medical personnel, emergency managers, and law enforcement officers. Specifically, these programs provide assistance for training, exercises, the purchase of equipment, and other support for terrorism and disaster preparedness and response activities. This report provides a table with requested funding amounts, and briefly discusses potential policy issues that Congress may want to address during the FY2011 budget and appropriations process. These issues include the proposed elimination of specific grant programs and a proposed reduction in funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Program. In the FY2011 budget request, the Administration denotes three categories of grants: State and Regional Preparedness Programs; Metropolitan Statistical Area Preparedness Programs; and Training, Measurement, and Exercise Programs. While the amounts requested generally resemble the appropriations for the current fiscal year, and funding for six programs would increase, the request includes no funding for seven programs. Table 1 provides information on the FY2010 enacted amounts and the FY2011 budget request for DHS's State and Local Programs. As Congress begins its appropriation process, Members may opt to consider issues associated with the Administration's proposed budget request for state and local homeland security assistance programs. Two of these issues include the elimination of seven programs and the reduction of funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Program. Both of these issues are linked in the Administration's budget request because eliminating assistance programs would reduce total appropriations unless funding for the remaining programs is increased. The Administration, however, does not request increases in all of the remaining programs. For some programs, the Administration requests a reduction in funding. For FY2011, the Administration proposed a total appropriation of $4.0 billion for state and local homeland security programs, which is $164 million less than Congress appropriated in FY2010. This proposed reduction in the total appropriation is a combination of reducing funding to some programs, such as the Assistance to Firefighters Program, and eliminating selected programs. These proposed reductions and elimination of certain programs are partially offset by proposed increases in funding for some programs, such as the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative. The Administration stated that the proposed reduction in the number of assistance programs would consolidate prior individual programs and expand the eligible activities of the remaining programs, which might result in increased competition among homeland security projects and stakeholders at the state and local levels. An example of this is the proposed elimination of the Interoperable Communications Program because both the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative allow grantees to purchase communication equipment. The Administration further states that the consolidation would increase state and locality discretion and encourage grantees to prioritize investments that meet specific homeland security needs that vary from grantee to grantee. The elimination of selected programs could potentially lead to two scenarios in which states and localities would attempt to continue funding all of their homeland security projects, including those that are eliminated but eligible under other programs, which might result in reduced funding for all homeland security projects; and would eliminate funding for selected homeland security projects. Congress could address this issue by increasing total appropriations for the remaining programs, thus reducing the possibility of some homeland security projects not being funded or being only partially funded. This option would not, however, reduce the competition at the state and local levels among stakeholders and homeland security projects. Conversely, Congress could take a different approach from the Administration's request and continue funding the programs that have been identified for elimination. This option might ensure that numerous homeland security projects receive baseline funding; however, this approach might result in less funding for larger programs such as the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative. Finally, Congress could agree with the Administration and eliminate funding for some assistance programs and reduce total appropriations. This option could cause grantees to prioritize their homeland security projects and allocate funding according to their needs. This option, however, might result in some grantees being unable to fund a number of projects they deem as needed. For FY2011, the Administration proposed $610 million for firefighter assistance programs, which is $200 million less than the FY2010 appropriation. Specifically, the Administration's FY2011 budget proposed $305 million for the Assistance to Firefighters Assistance Program (AFG)—a decrease of $95 million from the FY2010 level—and $305 million for the Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response Grant Program (SAFER)—a decrease of $105 million. The FY2011 request for AFG would be, if approved, the lowest amount appropriated since FY2001, the initial year of the program. The Administration's budget request does not provide information on why it has proposed to reduce AFG funding. Unlike many DHS grant programs, AFG employs a competitive grant process that awards funding directly to applying fire departments and Emergency Medical Service organizations. In recent years, the amount of total AFG funding requested in applications has continued to rise, from $2.3 billion in FY2006 to $3.2 billion in FY2009. Thus, the reduction of available funding in the assistance to firefighter programs could potentially heighten competition among fire departments for federal grant money. Ultimately, more fire departments would not receive federal grants for equipment, training, hiring, recruitment/retention, and other purposes, and would thus either rely more on local government budgets or go without. As it did in FY2010, Congress could choose to increase FY2011 funding for firefighter assistance over the level recommended by the Administration. Such a scenario would prevent a significant drop in the number of fire departments and EMS organizations receiving funding in FY2011. On the other hand, Congress could choose to agree with the Administration's request, thereby transferring more of the funding burden to the local level.", "completion": "response:\nThe President's budget request proposed total appropriations of $4.0 billion in FY2011 for homeland security assistance to states and localities, which is $164 million less than Congress appropriated in FY2010. These assistance programs are used by state and local governments, primarily first responder entities, to meet homeland security needs and enhance capabilities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from both man-made and natural disasters. The Administration's budget request not only proposes to reduce total appropriations for these programs, but also to eliminate some programs, such as the Metropolitan Medical Response System, the Emergency Operations Centers Program, and the Interoperable Communications Program. This report briefly discusses issues of debate associated with the budget request. This report will be updated as congressional appropriations actions warrant."}

Early organization and orientation have provided Members a \"leg up\" in addressing pressing needs. When the first Congress convened over 200 years ago, farmers and soldiers, journalists and scientists, carpenters and statesmen travelled from throughout the colonies to New York to take the oath of office as Members of the first Congress. They adopted rules, organized the structure of their chambers, and began legislating, each in accordance with the Member's own individual understanding of just how to do that and how to be both a representative and a legislator, that is, how to be a Member of Congress. There was no specific precedent to follow, no educational institution to attend to explore the intricacies of the legislative process, no classes to take to practice the politics of bicameralism and bipartisanship, no management consultant to teach them how to administer their offices. And so, these Members, and the hundreds who followed them, learned on the job, learned from their predecessors and each other, and learned from their mistakes. As the nation grew and prospered, and the number of Members increased with \"manifest destiny,\" it became clear that \"on the job training\" was no longer sufficient. The issues were becoming more complex, the procedures more intricate. In the early 1970s, nearly 200 years after the first Members arrived to legislate, Congress began to consider formalizing its pre-Congress preparations, both structural and educational. The belief seemed to be that the sooner the organizational decisions were made and the structure was in place, the faster the start Members would have in solving the problems of the day. As well, the more Members knew about the intricacies and complexities of those problems, the more sophisticated the deliberations would be, the sooner those deliberations could begin, and the more comprehensive and appropriate the eventual response would be. Accordingly, in 1974, pursuant to the adoption of H.Res. 988 (93 rd Congress), the Committee Reform Amendments of 1974, the House authorized early organizational meetings for its Members. The Senate followed suit soon thereafter. Speaker Carl Albert and Minority Leader Gerald Ford agreed that during the transition time between Congresses, preparation for the next Congress would be of invaluable help in reducing the organizational and legislative congestion that normally accompanies the start of a Congress. Prior to the convening of a new Congress (somewhere between November 13 and December 20 of any even-numbered year), Democratic party caucuses or Republican party conferences may be called by the majority and minority leaders after consultation with the Speaker. If done, the business is, among other things, to choose party leaders, committee leaders, and committee members. As well, Members can pick up political tips, technical and administrative lessons, policy facts, figures and interpretations, and a sense of the informal \"rules of the game.\" Members-elect receive travel and per diem allowances, while reelected Members receive travel allowances if the House has adjourned sine die . Both groups are expected to attend. In the past four decades, these meetings have become more formalized, more comprehensive, more valued, and more necessary. In fact, these sessions go far beyond those envisioned in 1974. Now, not only are there meetings for making organizational decisions, but also ones for educational purposes. Now, not only are they for Members, but some are for Members and staff together while others are for staff only. Some are for Members and their spouses, some even are limited to spouses of newly elected Members. Now, not only are they sponsored by the party caucus and conferences, but by the respective campaign committees, the House Administration and Senate Rules and Administration Committees, Harvard University's Institute of Politics, the Congressional Management Foundation, the Congressional Research Service, the Heritage Foundation, and numerous informal groups both on and off the Hill. Now, not only are they held in Washington, DC, but in Cambridge, MA, Annapolis, MD, and Williamsburg, VA, as well. Each is well attended. The educational sessions available range from legislative procedures, both in committee and on the floor, to how to hire a staff, and how to construct an office budget. They cover the broad range of current issues from defense to the environment to agriculture, from the specifics of a particular weapons system to the best method of reducing the federal deficit. They are taught by current Members, former Members, government practitioners, and academic experts. They focus on the substance of issues, previous attempts at legislative changes, the Administration's position, and the outlook for action in the current Congress. Numerous interest groups provide information for consideration, as does the party leadership. The organizational sessions serve as the first introduction to Congress and to each other for the new Members and attest to the value and intent of the early meetings envisioned in 1974. Accordingly, before the end of the year, class officers are elected, party leaders selected, and chamber officers, such as the chaplain, chosen. Regional representatives to steering and policy committees, designees to the committees on committees, and other party officials are named. Chairmen of selected committees are elected and members of those committees are often chosen. Each of these actions is then subject only to official ratification at the start of the Congress. Room selection drawings and room assignments are also accomplished during these sessions. Each January of a recent odd-numbered year, Congress has begun work earlier than it used to. Both chambers immediately make remaining committee assignments, while committees hold their organizational sessions to establish subcommittees, make subcommittee assignments, hire staff, and adopt committee rules. Accordingly, when the scores of measures introduced on the first day are referred to committee, Congress is ready to get to work on its legislative agenda without having to spend time on organizational and administrative matters.", "completion": "response:\nSince the mid-1970s, the House and Senate have convened early organization meetings in November or December of even-numbered years to prepare for the start of the new Congress in January. The purposes of these meetings are both educational and organizational. Educational sessions range from legislative procedures and staff hiring to current issues. Organizational sessions elect class officers, party leaders, and chamber officers; name committee representatives and other party officials; and select committee chairmen and often committee members. Such actions are officially ratified at the start of the new Congress."}

The provisions discussed in this report are part of a larger legislative package that was enacted to address a number of issues before Congress, including the need for an extension of temporary appropriations set to expire on February 8, 2018. An early version of this package was added by the House to H.R. 1892 (an unrelated measure), in the form of an amendment to an amendment that had been previously adopted by the Senate during its consideration of H.R. 1892 . The House adopted its amendment on February 6, 2018, by a vote of 245-182. The Senate subsequently took up the House proposal and adopted a further amendment to it on February 9, by a vote of 71-28. The House agreed to the Senate actions that same day by a vote of 240-186. The final version of H.R. 1892 , enacted as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-123 ), contained FY2018 temporary continuing appropriations, FY2018 supplemental appropriations, an increase to the debt limit, increases to the statutory spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019, tax provisions, and numerous provisions extending or making changes to mandatory spending programs, among other topics. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimate, Division E of BBA 2018 is estimated to increase direct spending outlays by a total of $829 million, and increase on- and off-budget revenues by a total of $4.6 billion, for a net savings of $3.8 billion over the period of FY2018 through FY2027.

The results of other roll call votes, on the measure or any amendment to it, and tabulations of votes cast by each member in favor and against a question must be included unless the votes were \"previously announced\" by the committee. (Rule XXVI, paragraphs 7(b) and (c).) In general, the Senate report on a measure (except continuing appropriations), which provides new budget authority, or changes revenues or tax expenditures, must contain: (a) a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimate for the first fiscal year affected and the four subsequent fiscal years; and (b) a CBO estimate of new budget authority provided for assistance to state and local governments. The Senate Appropriations Committee also must include a comparison of the levels in an appropriations measure to the appropriate subcommittee allocations (the so-called 302(b) allocations). (Section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act. Related requirements are contained in Section 402 of the Budget Act, and Rule XXVI, paragraph 11(a).) An authorizing committee's report on a public bill or joint resolution that includes a federal mandate must contain an identification and description of the mandate. This must comprise the direct costs to state, local, and tribal governments, and the private sector; an assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits; and a statement on the effect on both the public and private sectors, including on the competitive balance between them. If the mandates are intergovernmental, the report also must contain statements on the amount of authorizations under federal financial assistance programs; whether the mandates are partly or entirely unfunded; how any funding will be allocated; additional sources of federal financial assistance; and a statement of how the committee intends States to implement any funding reductions. Reports on measures containing federal intergovernmental or private sector mandates also must contain CBO statements on the direct costs of the mandates. (Sections 423 and 424 of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended.) A report by an authorizing committee on a public bill or joint resolution must contain, if relevant, a statement on the extent to which the measure preempts any state, local, or tribal law, and the effect of any such preemption. (Section 423 of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended.) A committee report (except by the Appropriations Committee) on a public bill or joint resolution generally must contain an evaluation of its regulatory impact, including information on (a) the individuals and businesses who would be regulated; (b) the economic impact of regulation on affected individuals, consumers, and businesses; (c) the impact on personal privacy; and (d) the amount of paperwork and record keeping required. These estimates are not required if the report states why compliance is \"impracticable.\" (Rule XXVI, paragraphs 11(b) and (c).) A report on a bill or joint resolution relating to terms and conditions of employment or access to public services or accommodations must describe how the provisions apply to the legislative branch. If a provision is not applicable to the legislative branch, the report must explain why. ( P.L. 104-1 , Section 102(b)(3).) A committee report on a measure that changes existing law must contain: (a) the text of the statute, or part thereof, proposed to be changed; and (b) a comparative print of the part of the measure making the change and the statute proposed to be amended. This information is not required if the report states that its omission is necessary \"to expedite the business of the Senate.\" (Rule XXVI, paragraph 12.)

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOn March 4, 2015, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in King v. Burwell . A final decision is expected by the end of June. The central issue in the case is whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended) gave authority to the U.S. Department of the Treasury to make premium tax credits available to eligible individuals in every state (including the District of Columbia) or just the states that chose to establish their own health insurance exchanges (state-based exchanges, or SBEs). While the direction and scope of the Court decision is not known, if the Court decides that tax credits may be made available only in SBEs, such a decision may lead to the loss of tax credits in a majority of states where the federal government established the exchanges (federally facilitated exchanges, or FFEs). Given that several million individuals currently receive tax credits through FFEs, the Court decision could have major implications for individual consumers, exchanges, insurers, and other stakeholders. Loss of premium tax credits would directly affect the affordability of health insurance for the consumers who no longer have the credits. Some individuals may choose to drop coverage as a consequence or seek more affordable insurance, if available. Others may be motivated to continue to purchase coverage, even without a subsidy, either because the credit amounts they received were minimal or they have serious health care needs. Insurers may decide to change plan offerings or discontinue offering individual health insurance policies in a given state in anticipation of a reduction in overall enrollment. Consumers and insurers that continue to participate in exchanges and the market outside of exchanges may see premiums increase in response to the changes to the insurance risk pool . These consumer and insurer actions may, in turn, motivate Congress, the Administration, and/or states to address perceived adverse effects of the Court decision and address other related issues, such as the tax credit program's interaction with the ACA's other coverage provisions. Given that a Court decision favoring the plantiffs would directly affect the health insurance options of millions of consumers, which, in turn, may motivate insurers, legislators, and policymakers to act, this report provides the time frame in which decisions concerning exchanges and health insurance more broadly may occur, given current regulations and guidance. To the extent that consumers and others (referred to as stakeholders in this report) may be motivated to respond to the Court decision (and respond to other stakeholder actions), this report provides a timeline that identifies selected 2015 dates related to exchange establishment and operation, legislative calendars, and regulation of the individual health insurance market, among other issues. The report concludes with a table that augments the 2015 timeline by identifying relevant sources of information, such as statutory or regulatory citations related to exchanges. While this information may be useful to set parameters around certain stakeholder actions, this report is not meant as a guide to decisionmaking, nor does it attempt to identify all possible stakeholder responses to the upcoming Court decision. While CRS does not predict a particular direction of the Court decision, certain underlying assumptions were made to simplify identification of important dates. Those assumptions include no retroactive effect of the decision and no delay for when the decision would go into effect. As indicated above, the direction and scope of the Court decision is not known. Implications of the decision beyond issues related to private health insurance are outside the scope of this report. Moreover, the Court decision may maintain the status quo. Nonetheless, legislators and policymakers may be interested in addressing other issues related to the credits or the ACA more broadly. The dates and potential stakeholder actions included in this report may still apply under such a scenario. The potential for the Court decision to affect a number of different stakeholders reflects the current structure of the private market for health insurance and the interplay among key participants in the overall market. At the most basic level, the health insurance \"market\" works like any other market: with sellers and buyers of products. In this case, insurers sell health insurance plans for purchase by consumers and employers. The market for health insurance, like other forms of insurance, is regulated primarily at the state level. However, the federal government has expanded its role in the regulation of this industry, most recently with the enactment and continuing implementation of the ACA. The ACA itself contains multiple provisions that impose requirements on most of these stakeholders, create new stakeholders (e.g., exchanges), and link requirements across stakeholders. The stakeholders are identified below, and their role in or potential to affect the private health insurance market is briefly described. To the extent any of the stakeholders respond to the Court's decision, their motivation and ability to do so is subject to a variety of parameters, including requirements and flexibilities under current law and the actions taken by other stakeholders. For example, if a state wanted to change its exchange type (i.e., from an SBE to an FFE or vice versa), it must follow a set process. The process includes submitting required documents to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by certain dates and, in some cases, enacting a state law indicating that the activity is allowed by the state. Congress may be motivated to respond to the Court's decision through legislation. Consumers are expected to comply with the terms of their health insurance coverage, such as paying premiums. Changes to the conditions under which the consumer obtains health insurance may result in changes in how and whether consumers obtain coverage. Employers that are considered large are expected to comply with the ACA's employer mandate. The penalty associated with noncompliance is triggered only if an employee receives a premium tax credit. HHS , as the entity primarily responsible for issuing exchange-related regulations and guidance, defines the parameters under which all exchanges operate. For example, HHS is responsible for determining the process by which a state can elect to operate a state-based exchange. Additionally, HHS administers the federally facilitated exchanges. Health i nsurance e xchanges (also referred to as marketplaces), whether state-based or federally facilitated, are expected to operate within the parameters established under the ACA and its implementing regulations, such as adhering to the annual and special open enrollment periods set in regulations. However, the ACA and its implementing regulations give exchanges some discretion over certain operational decisions, particularly with respect to how exchanges interact with insurers. Private h ealth i nsurers offering coverage through exchanges must ensure that the coverage they offer complies with state and federal regulations and all exchange-related requirements, whether set by HHS or the exchange. States , in general, have the authority to regulate their private health insurance markets. Depending on the state, the authority may be more or less under the control of the state legislature. With respect to exchanges, a state that elects to operate an exchange must do so within established exchange parameters. These parameters are included in statute and described in regulations and guidance issued by HHS. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in King v. Burwell by the end of its term in June 2015. Figure 1 and Table 1 show selected activities currently required to be carried out by one or more of the stakeholders and the time frame in which the activities are expected to occur. These activities are not dependent on the Court decision ; instead, they represent the current status of regulations, guidance, and other time-sensitive rules that stakeholders may consider if and when they decide to respond to the decision.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nIn 2003, Maine passed laws that instituted requirements for shipping and delivery sales of tobacco products that attempted to end sales to minors. The state argued that such laws helped the state \"prevent minors from obtaining cigarettes.\" The first law at issue, the \"recipient-verification\" provision, stated: The tobacco retailer shall utilize a delivery service that imposes the following requirements: 1) The purchaser must be the addressee; 2) The addressee must be of legal age to purchase tobacco products and must sign for the package; and 3) If the addressee is under 27 years of age, the addressee must show valid government-issued identification that contains a photograph of the addressee and indicates that the addressee is of legal age to purchase tobacco products. The second law, referred to as the \"deemed to know\" provision, stated: A person is deemed to know that a package contains a tobacco product if the package is marked in accordance with the requirements of section 1555-C, subsection 3, paragraph B [\"The tobacco retailer shall clearly mark the outside of the package of tobacco products to be shipped to indicate that the contents are tobacco products and to show the name and State of Maine tobacco license number of the tobacco retailer.\"] or if the person receives the package from a person listed as an unlicensed tobacco retailer by the Attorney General under this section. Violators of either provision could be subject to civil penalties. In Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Association , the Supreme Court held that the two Maine provisions were preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA). That law prohibited states from \"enact[ing] or enforc[ing] a law ... related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.\" This language was similar to language previously enacted in the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, which included a preemption provision stating \"no State ... shall enact or enforce any law ... relating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier.\" The Supreme Court had analyzed the air carrier preemption language in Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. and held that \"federal law pre-empts States from enforcing their consumer-fraud statutes against deceptive airline-fare advertisements.\" In finding that Maine's mail-order tobacco product delivery laws were preempted, the Court relied on its interpretation of the preemption language at issue in Morales . The Court indicated that passage of the FAAAA motor carrier preemption language took into account its previous interpretation of the air carrier preemption language in Morales . The Morales Court found that preemption could occur even if the state law only had an indirect effect on carrier rates, routes, or services and that preemption did occur if \"state laws have a 'significant impact' related to Congress's deregulatory and pre-emption-related objectives.\" However, the Morales Court effectively said that preemption may not occur if the state law affects carrier rates, routes, or services \"in only a 'tenuous, remote, or peripheral ... manner.\" The Rowe Court first held that Maine's recipient-verification provision had a \"direct 'connection with' motor carrier services\" because \"it focuse[d] on trucking and other motor carrier services\" and that the Maine law had \"a 'significant' and adverse 'impact' in respect to the federal Act's ability to achieve its pre-emption-related objectives.\" Therefore, the Rowe Court found that federal law preempted Maine's recipient-verification provision. The Court reasoned that Maine's law had the effect of substituting \"government commands for 'competitive market forces' in determining ... the services that motor carriers will provide.\" The Rowe Court next held that Maine's \"deemed to know\" provision \"applies yet more directly to motor carrier services\" because the provision would \"impose[] civil liability upon the carrier\" if the carrier did not check each tobacco shipment \"for certain markings and ... compare it against the Maine attorney general's list of proscribed shippers.\" As a result, the Court found that Maine's law would affect \"Congress' major legislative effort to leave ... decisions, where federally unregulated, to the competitive marketplace,\" because if the Court allowed Maine's shipment checking system, then other states could impose their own shipment checking systems. This would appear to result in a \"significant impact\" on Congress's deregulatory objectives. Thus, the Rowe Court held that federal law preempts Maine's regulation \"of the essential details of a motor carrier's system for picking-up, sorting, and carrying goods—essential details of the carriage itself.\" In making this determination, the Court rejected Maine's argument that federal law did not \"preempt a State's efforts to protect its citizens' public health\" and its assertion that its laws should not be preempted because they helped prevent underage smoking. Maine based its argument on the legislative history of the FAAAA and the Synar Amendment. The legislative history reference was to a conference report \"containing a list of nine States, with laws resembling Maine's, that Congress thought did not regulate 'intrastate prices, routes and services of motor carriers.'\" The Court held that the FAAAA did not include a public health exception for preemption of state laws. First, the Court stated that the legislative history did not indicate that Congress made a determination on or \"focused upon\" the delivery regulation issue. Second, the Court discounted Maine's reliance on the Synar Amendment, which \"does not mention specific state enforcement methods.\" The Court further referenced the potentially broad nature of a \"public health\" exception to federal preemption of state laws related to carriers, noting \"the number of products, the variety of potential adverse public health effects, ... and the difficulty of finding a legal criterion for separating permissible public-health-oriented regulations\" and found that Congress did not likely intend to create a public health exception that could potentially affect tobacco shipments. However, the Rowe Court stated that general state public health laws would not always be preempted by federal law and that federal law would not preempt state laws with a \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\" connection to carrier rates, routes, or services. Maine had further argued that because it could legally ban tobacco shipments \"from entering into or moving within the State,\" it had the power \"to regulate the manner of tobacco shipments.\" The Court also rejected this argument, noting that such regulation would allow the state to regulate carrier rates, routes, and services, and that federal law preempts such state laws that have a \"significant impact\" and more than a \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\" effect. The Court also found that Maine's laws would be preempted for these reasons, regardless of whether, as Maine alleged, the overturning of Maine's laws would hurt its efforts to stop underage smoking. Justice Ginsburg \"wr[o]te separately to emphasize the large regulatory gap left by an application of the FAAAA perhaps overlooked by Congress, and the urgent need ... to fill that gap.\" In particular, she restated the concerns of Maine and others that age verification methods for mail-order sales of tobacco products could be used as an enforcement strategy to prevent tobacco sales to minors but noted that the FAAAA preemption provisions block states from enacting such methods. She stated that there is a lack of federal tobacco laws aimed at preventing tobacco sales to minors. Her concurrence then stated that state tobacco control measures, such as those that resulted from the Synar Amendment, \"are increasingly thwarted by the ease with which tobacco products can be purchased through the Internet.\" Legislation has been introduced in the 110 th Congress, including H.R. 4081 and S. 1027 , the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act, that would address sales of tobacco products over the internet. Justice Scalia, who is well-known for not favoring the use of legislative history as a method of interpreting congressional intent, issued a one sentence concurrence. He joined the Court's opinion except where it relied on congressional committee reports to demonstrate congressional intent \"with regard to propositions that are apparent from the text of the law, unnecessary to the disposition of the case, or both.\"", "completion": "response:\nMaine adopted two laws regarding shipping and delivery sales of tobacco products that were aimed at preventing minors from acquiring tobacco products.

During the 110 th Congress, the House passed similar legislation, H.R. 1905 , by a vote of 241 to 177. A similar bill, S. 1257 , was considered by the Senate, but a motion to invoke cloture failed by a vote of 57 to 42. This report discusses the constitutionality of the aspect of this legislation that would create an at-large congressional district. For discussion of other issues relating to this legislation, see CRS Report RL33824, The Constitutionality of Awarding the Delegate for the District of Columbia a Vote in the House of Representatives or the Committee of the Whole , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report RS22579, District of Columbia Representation: Effect on House Apportionment , by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report RL33830, District of Columbia Voting Representation in Congress: An Analysis of Legislative Proposals , by [author name scrubbed]. The U.S. Constitution provides the states with primary authority over congressional elections, but grants Congress the final authority over most aspects of such elections. This congressional power is at its most broad in the case of House elections, which have historically been decided by a system of popular voting. Article I, § 4, cl. 1 provides that The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. The Supreme Court and lower courts have interpreted this language to mean that Congress has extensive power to regulate most elements of congressional elections, including a broad authority to protect the integrity of those elections. The Constitution does not specify how members of the House are to be elected once they are apportioned to a state. Originally, most states having more than one Representative divided their territory into geographic districts, permitting only one member of Congress to be elected from each district. Other states, however, allowed House candidates to run at-large or from multi-member districts or from some combination of the two. In those states employing single-member districts, however, the problem of gerrymandering, the practice of drawing district lines in order to maximize political party advantage, quickly arose. Accordingly, Congress began establishing standards for House districts. Congress first passed federal redistricting standards in 1842, when it added a requirement to the apportionment act of that year that Representatives \"should be elected by districts composed of contiguous territory equal in number to the number of Representatives to which each said state shall be entitled, no one district electing more than one Representative.\" (5 Stat. 491.) The Apportionment Act of 1872 added another requirement to those first set out in 1842, stating that districts should contain \"as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants.\" (17 Stat. 492.) A further requirement of \"compact territory\" was added when the Apportionment Act of 1901 was adopted stating that districts must be made up of \"contiguous and compact territory and containing as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants.\" (26 Stat. 736.) Although these standards were never enforced if the states failed to meet them, this language was repeated in the 1911 Apportionment Act and remained in effect until 1929, with the adoption of the Permanent Apportionment Act, which did not include any districting standards. After 1929, there were no congressionally imposed standards governing congressional redistricting; in 1941, however, Congress enacted a law providing for various contingencies if states failed to redistrict after a census—including at-large representation. (55 Stat 761.) In 1967, Congress reimposed the requirement that Representatives must run from single-member districts, rather than running at-large. (81 Stat. 581.) Both the 1941 and 1967 laws are still in effect, codified at 2 U.S.C. §§ 2a and 2c. In Branch v. Smith , the Supreme Court considered the operation and inherent tension between these two provisions. The question of congressional authority was not in dispute in this litigation. Rather, the Court noted in passing that the current statutory scheme governing apportionment of the House of Representatives was enacted in 1929 pursuant to congressional authority under the \"Times, Places and Manner\" provision of the Constitution. Consequently, it seems likely that Congress has broad authority, within specified constitutional parameters, to establish how members' districts will be established, including the creation of at-large districts. It might be suggested that creating an at-large congressional district in a state could violate the \"one person, one vote\" standard established by the Supreme Court in Wesberry v. Sanders. In Wesberry , the Supreme Court first applied the one person, one vote standard in the context of evaluating the constitutionality of a Georgia congressional redistricting statute that created a district with two to three times as many residents as the state's other nine districts. In striking down the statute, the Court held that Article I, section 2, clause 1, providing that Representatives be chosen \"by the People of the several States\" and be \"apportioned among the several States ... according to their respective Numbers,\" requires that \"as nearly as is practicable, one man's vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another's.\" While it is not beyond dispute, it does not appear that the creation of an at-large district under the circumstances outlined in H.R. 157 would be interpreted to create a conflict with the \"one person, one vote\" standard. Under H.R. 157 , each Utah voter would have the opportunity to vote both for a candidate to represent his or her congressional district as well as for a candidate to represent the state at-large. Each person's vote for an at-large candidate would be of equal worth. Further, each person's vote for an at-large candidate would not affect the value of his or her vote for a candidate representing a congressional district. Accordingly, all Utah residents' votes would have equal value, thereby arguably comporting with the one person, one vote principle. Based on the authority granted to Congress under the Constitution to regulate congressional elections and relevant Supreme Court precedent, it appears that a federal law establishing a temporary at-large congressional district would likely be upheld as constitutional.", "completion": "response:\nThis report discusses the constitutionality of legislation, such as the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009, H.R. 157 (111th Congress), that would create an at-large congressional district. While it is not without doubt, based on the authority granted to Congress under the Constitution to regulate congressional elections and relevant Supreme Court precedent, it appears that federal law establishing a temporary at-large congressional district would likely be upheld as constitutional. H.R. 157, among other provisions, would expand the U.S. House of Representatives by two members to a total of 437 members. The first of these two new seats would be allocated to create a voting member representing the District of Columbia. The second seat would be assigned in accordance with 2000 census data and existing federal law, resulting in the addition of a fourth congressional seat in the state of Utah that would be a temporary at-large district. On March 2, 2009, the House Judiciary Committee reported the bill, as amended (H.Rept. 111-22), but no further action was taken by the House.

The incident disabled the facility and led to a full evacuation before the platform sank into the Gulf on April 22. A significant release of oil at the sea floor was soon discovered. According to the National Incident Command's Flow Rate Technical Group estimate of August 2, 2010, the well released approximately 206 million gallons of oil (4.9 million barrels) before it was contained July 15, 2010. The 2010 Gulf oil spill has generated considerable interest in oil spill issues. The House of Representatives has conducted at least 33 hearings in 10 committees. The Senate has conducted at least 30 hearings in eight committees. Members have introduced over 150 legislative proposals that include one or more provisions that would affect oil spill policy. This report focuses primarily on oil spill policy matters that concern prevention, preparedness, response, and the liability and compensation framework. For the most part, the underlying statutes for these provisions are found in either the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-380 ; 33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) or the Clean Water Act and its amendments (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.).

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nCongress has expressed interest in federal programs and activities addressing tsunami detection, warning, research, education, and outreach because of the tsunami hazard to the United States, particularly to Pacific Northwest, Northern California, Alaska, and Hawaii, as well as regions of the Caribbean and Atlantic coastline. The Japanese tsunami of March 11, 2011, illustrated the potential for damage and loss of life posed by a potential tsunami in the Pacific. A fault system off the northwestern United States, called the Cascadia Subduction Zone, is similar to the fault system responsible for the 2011 Japanese tsunami disaster. Oregon, Washington, Northern California, Hawaii, and Alaska all face some risk if the Cascadia fault ruptures. Congress passed the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2017 as Title V of P.L. 115-25 , on April 4, 2017; President Trump signed the bill into law as P.L. 115-25 on April 18, 2017. Title V of P.L. 115-25 amends P.L. 109-479 , Title VIII, the Tsunami Warning and Education Act, which was enacted on January 12, 2007. The new law does not make fundamental changes to the federal government's tsunami activities, which include tsunami forecasting and warning, mitigation, and research, as well as other tsunami-related activities. However, it does broaden the purposes of the federal activities, increasing focus on tsunami research, promoting community resilience to tsunami hazards, and refining requirements for standards and guidelines to improve education and outreach activities and tsunami mapping and modeling. The new law authorizes appropriations of $25.8 million per year for FY2016 through FY2021. An ongoing question for the U.S. tsunami program and related activities is whether Congress will appropriate funds matching the amounts authorized in P.L. 115-25 to carry out the existing program as well as the new activities and priorities in the law. Another challenge is how Congress should evaluate the effectiveness of the program. A perennial issue for NOAA is keeping its constellation of Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) buoys operational, and the new law specifies a goal of keeping at least 80% of the buoy system operational at all times. More generally, because Title V of P.L. 115-25 adds an emphasis on research throughout the program, a future question is how well research results are incorporated into tsunami resilience, education, warning, and other activities. Also, damaging tsunami events are relatively rare for the United States, so it is difficult to assess the overall effect of tsunami program activities on an annual basis. If a large and damaging tsunami were to strike the United States, an additional challenge for Congress would be to sort out how effective the program was at reducing the amount of damage and the number of injuries and fatalities. In addition, the bill repeals P.L. 109-424 , the Tsunami Warning and Education Act, also passed by the 109 th Congress. P.L. 109-424 was signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 20, 2006, and is nearly identical to P.L. 109-479 . P.L. 115-25 removes any potential for ambiguity by repealing one of the existing laws. This report provides a section-by-section comparison of text quoted from P.L. 115-25 and P.L. 109-479 , shown in Table 1 , with some brief comments from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) pointing out selected changes and how those changes affect P.L. 109-479 and the tsunami activities it authorized (far right column of Table 1 ).

The CRS comments generally address the sections or parts of sections in the same row of the table.", "completion": "response:\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) National Weather Service (NWS) manages two tsunami warning centers, which monitor, detect, and issue warnings for tsunamis. The NWS operates the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) at Ford Island, HI, and the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) at Palmer, AK. The tsunami warning centers monitor and evaluate data from seismic networks and determine if a tsunami is likely based on the location, magnitude, and depth of an earthquake. The centers monitor relevant water-level data, typically with tide-level gauges, and data from NOAA's network of Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) detection buoys to confirm that a tsunami has been generated or to cancel any warnings if no tsunami is detected. In the 114th Congress, the House passed legislation amending U.S. tsunami activities (H.R. 34) and the Senate passed similar legislation (Title V of H.R. 1561). However, the 114th Congress did not enact a final version of the legislation. The 115th Congress passed the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2017 as Title V of P.L. 115-25 on April 4, 2017. The bill was signed into law on April 18, 2017.

On February 5, 1798, Mathers's duties were expanded when he was \"invested with the authority of Sergeant-at-Arms, to hold said office during the pleasure of the Senate, whose duty it shall be to execute the commands of the Senate, from time to time, and all such process as shall be directed to him by the President of the Senate.\" Initially, the Senate met in closed-door sessions and it was the responsibility of the Doorkeeper to ensure that a quorum of Senators was present and that other interested parties were kept out of the chamber. This officer is hereafter referred to as Sergeant at Arms. Today, the Sergeant at Arms performs the original duties of the doorkeeper and is responsible for the protection of the Senate wing of the Capitol, the Senate office buildings, and the Senate chamber. In addition, the Sergeant at Arms serves as the Senate's chief protocol officer and has administrative responsibility for Senate offices and other Senate services, including the Senate beauty and barber shops, the Senate garage, the Senate post office, the Senate recording studio, and the Senate photographic studio. The Sergeant at Arms is elected by the Senate and serves \"from Congress to Congress until a successor is chosen.\" The duties and responsibilities of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper have developed over time through several sources. These sources include statutes, Senate rules and orders, and customs and precedents. Statues, rules and orders, and other materials may be found in the United States Code , which is the codification, by subject matter, of the general and permanent laws of the United States; the United States Statutes at Large , which is the collection of all laws and concurrent resolutions enacted during each session of Congress, published in the order they were enacted into law; the Senate Manual , which contains the texts of the (1) Standing Rules of the Senate, (2) Standing Orders of the Senate, (3) rules for the Regulation of the Senate Wing of the United States Capitol, and (4) excerpts from law applicable to the Senate; and custom and precedent. Additionally, many of the duties of the Sergeant at Arms are defined by the Senate Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. As a consequence of its jurisdiction over Senate administrative matters, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration oversees operations of the Sergeant at Arms. The duties and responsibilities of Sergeant at Arms can be divided into three broad categories: law enforcement and security, protocol, and administration. Each category reflects the basic responsibility to ensure safe and effective operation of the Senate. As the Senate's chief law enforcement officer, the Sergeant at Arms is responsible for security in the Senate wing of the Capitol, the Senate office buildings, adjacent grounds, and for the security of Senators. At the request of a majority of Senators present on the floor, the Sergeant at Arms also has the authority to compel the attendance of absent Senators. The Sergeant at Arms enforces rules made by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and serves as a member of the Capitol Police Board, which is authorized by law to design, install, and maintain security systems for the Capitol and its grounds. Together with the Secretary of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms develops and maintains a continuity-of-operations plan that enables the Senate to conduct business and access data at offsite locations, and oversees the office of security and emergency preparedness, which serves as the Senate's emergency planning and response team. As the chief of protocol of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms performs ceremonial functions that exist through custom and precedent. In carrying out these duties, the Sergeant at Arms greets and escorts the U.S. President, heads of states, and other official Senate guests while attending functions in the Capitol; leads Senators from the Senate side of the Capitol to the House chamber for joint sessions of Congress, to their places on the inaugural platform, and to any other place the Senate travels as a body; and assists in arrangements for inaugurations and the planning of funerals of Senators who die while in office. By custom, the Sergeant at Arms is custodian of the Senate gavel. The Sergeant at Arms is responsible for protocol surrounding the death of a Senator. These responsibilities include the enforcement of a provision in the Standing Orders of the Senate which prohibits flowers in the Senate chamber unless an order is given waiving the prohibition for a display of flowers on the desk of a deceased Senator on the day of eulogies. The Sergeant at Arms also ascertains that the construction of a monument to a deceased Senator, who is to be buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., conforms to specific construction materials and procedures. As an administrative officer of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms is responsible for specified services to Senators' offices, including the following: acquiring home state office space, including mobile office space; purchasing office equipment and maintaining records of equipment use; operating computer support services; managing telecommunications services; establishing prices of items available for use in Senate offices; and administering orientation seminars for Senators, Senate officials, or members of the staffs of Senators or Senate officials and other similar meetings. The administrative duties of the Sergeant at Arms also include services to the Senate as a whole, including the following: Senate service department, which is responsible for production of newsletters and other Senate mailings, purchase and maintenance of equipment, storage of Senate publications, and micrographics services; Senate computer center, which oversees Senate computer operations; Senate post office, and recording and photographic studios; Senate barber and beauty shops; custodial services, office furnishings and equipment, and automobiles; Senate garage and other parking facilities; appointment desk to greet visitors on official business; Senate health promotion office; Senate placement office; Senate telecommunications, the Capitol telephone exchange, and the Senate telephone directory; Capitol Guide Service and other visitor services including assistance in Braille, sign language interpretation, and telecommunications devices for the deaf; Senate page program and assignment of duties to messengers; oversight of the doorkeepers; issuance of identification cards to Senate employees; disposal of surplus equipment; and education and training programs for Senate staff as needed.

Business filings peaked in 1987, but the number of consumer filings continued to grow through 2005. In that year, the number of filings surpassed 2 million—there was a \"rush to the courthouse\" before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA; P.L. 109-8 ) took effect in October 2005. In 2006, filings dropped sharply, suggesting that the new law caused many to accelerate their filings, and that many petitions that would have been filed in 2006 (or later) were pushed forward by bankruptcy reform. Whether BAPCPA will reduce filings in the long run is still unclear. Filings rose steadily from the 2006 lows until 2010, when they exceeded 1.5 million, which was approximately the level during the four years before BAPCPA. Over the first three quarters of 2011, there was a slight decline from the year-earlier numbers. Table 2 shows figures on household debt. The major categories of household debt are mortgage debt and consumer credit, which together comprise about 97% of all household indebtedness. Consumer credit consists of (1) revolving credit, or credit card debt, and (2) non-revolving debt, which is dominated by auto and college loans (though it also includes loans for boats, mobile homes, vacations, and so on). Mortgage debt is borrowing secured by real estate. A subcategory within mortgage debt, home equity lending, is broken out in the table because it may substitute for consumer credit in many cases. Table 2 also includes Federal Reserve estimates of the burden of debt service—that is, the percentage of household disposable income that goes to repay loans. Over the past decade, this measure rose steadily (but not dramatically), until the recession and financial crisis that began in 2007. The debt burden figures in Table 2 fluctuate within a fairly narrow range: from 10.80% to 13.93%. (During the 1980s, the range was similar: from 10.6% to 12.5%.) Although the burden of debt has risen since the 1980s, the increase has been gradual and would not appear to explain much of the fivefold increase in personal bankruptcy filings over the past two decades. Moreover, the decline in the debt service ration since 2007 has not been accompanied by a significant reduction in bankruptcy rates. Interest rates paid by consumers—particularly mortgage rates—declined in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1950s, and they remain low. The relative stability of the debt burden in the face of falling and historically low interest rates implies that the ratio of debt outstanding to income has been rising. This ratio—the sum of consumer and mortgage debt expressed as a percentage of disposable personal income—is shown in the far right column of Table 2 . The increases in this figure, which between 1990 and 2007 rose more than twice as fast as the debt burden, suggest that further increases in bankruptcy filings (and perhaps problems for lenders) may lie ahead if interest rates should rise suddenly or unexpectedly. Since 1980, however, declining interest rates have permitted households to take on more debt without a comparable increase in the interest payments required to service that debt. The aggregate household debt numbers mask important differences among families: some have done very well in the long booms of the 1980s and 1990s, while others have taken on debt that they have difficulty repaying. Table 3 below, based on the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, shows the percentages of families at various income levels that devote more than 40% of their income to debt service, for selected years from 1995 through 2007. Two noteworthy facts emerge from the data in Table 3 . The first is the high rate of distress among lower-income families, who are the most likely to file for bankruptcy. Second, like the debt burden figures shown in Table 2 , there is no sharply rising trend that would explain the dramatic increase in personal bankruptcy filings. The percentage of all families in distress in 2007 was little changed from the 1998 level. The 2007 figures do show a notable increase among families in the upper income percentiles; this may be attributable to increased mortgage debt taken on during the housing boom that ended in that year. The question remains why so many families at or below the national median income take on high levels of debt and end up in bankruptcy court. Some explanations focus on particularly vulnerable populations: the sick and uninsured (or underinsured), the divorced, or residents of states without mandatory uninsured motorist coverage. Supporters of the bankruptcy reform measure finally enacted in 2005 argued that the bankruptcy code was too debtor-friendly and created an incentive to borrow beyond the ability to repay, or in some cases without the intention of repaying. Opponents of reform claimed that financial distress is often a by-product of the marketing strategies of credit card issuers and other consumer lenders. Lack of a consensus explanation for the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings suggests that the issue will remain controversial. In December 2007, the U.S. economy went into recession, in the midst of global financial panic. Household debt levels began to fall in three of the four categories shown in Table 2 . The decline in debt balances continued for 11 calendar quarters, until debt outstanding rose slightly in the second quarter of 2011. In the third quarter, debt levels fell again. On a percentage basis, home equity and credit card debt led the decline, as shown in Table 4 . In dollar terms, however, mortgage debt (other than home equity loans) accounted for most of the drop. Several factors appear to have contributed to the fall in debt balances. Some households may be paying down their debt, others may be borrowing less, and the amount of debt written off by lenders as uncollectible has increased. Some lenders have tightened their credit standards for new loans. Mortgage balances have fallen because of mortgage modifications or other negotiations that reduce principal outstanding, and because foreclosed homes are often sold for less than the amount of the old mortgage. Causes and implications of deleveraging are discussed in CRS Report R41623, U.S. Household Debt Reduction , by [author name scrubbed].", "completion": "response:\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA; P.L. 109-8) included the most significant amendments to consumer bankruptcy procedures since the 1970s. Bankruptcy reform was enacted in response to the high number of consumer bankruptcy filings, which in 2004 and 2005 reached five times the level of the early 1980s. Why did filings increase so dramatically during a period that included two of the longest economic expansions in U.S. history? Because bankruptcy is by definition a condition of excessive debt, many would expect to see a corresponding increase in the debt burden of U.S. households over the same period. However, while household debt has indeed grown, debt costs as a percentage of income have risen only moderately. What aggregate statistics do not show is that the debt burden does not fall evenly on all families. Financial distress is common among lower-income households: in 2007, 27% of families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution spent more than 40% of their income to repay debt. Following the effective date of BAPCPA, in October 2005, there was a sharp reduction in the number of bankruptcy filings, reflecting the \"rush to the courthouse\" in the months before the new law took effect. Since the 2006 lows, the number of filings has risen steadily. In 2010, personal bankruptcy filings reached 1.5 million, roughly equal to the pre-BAPCPA level. It appears that BAPCPA has not produced the effect its supporters hoped for—a substantial and permanent reduction in the rate of consumer bankruptcy. With the recession that began in December 2007, the long-term upward trend in consumer indebtedness was interrupted. Beginning in the middle of 2008, the amount of debt held by U.S. households declined for 11 consecutive quarters. Through the third quarter of 2011, households reduced their debt burden by $853 billion, or 6.5%. Causes and implications of this trend are discussed in CRS Report R41623, U.S. Household Debt Reduction, by [author name scrubbed]. This report presents statistics on bankruptcy filings, household debt, and families in financial distress. It will be updated as new statistics become available."}

In some instances, the President makes these appointments using authorities granted by law to the President alone. Other appointments are made with the advice and consent of the Senate via the nomination and confirmation of appointees. Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation are often referred to with the abbreviation PAS. This report identifies, for the 113 th Congress, all nominations to full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation in 40 organizations in the executive branch (27 independent agencies, 6 agencies in the Executive Office of the President [EOP], and 7 multilateral organizations) and 4 agencies in the legislative branch. It excludes appointments to executive departments and to regulatory and other boards and commissions, which are covered in other CRS reports. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) at http://www.lis.gov/nomis/ , the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents , telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code , and the 2012 Plum Book ( United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions ). Related Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports regarding the presidential appointments process, nomination activity for other executive branch positions, recess appointments, and other appointments-related matters may be found at http://www.crs.gov . During the 113 th Congress, President Barack Obama submitted 69 nominations to the Senate for full-time positions in independent agencies, agencies in the EOP, multilateral agencies, and legislative branch agencies. Of these nominations, 34 were confirmed, 34 were returned to the President, and 1 was withdrawn. Table 1 summarizes the appointment activity. The length of time a given nomination may be pending in the Senate varies widely. Some nominations are confirmed within a few days, others are not confirmed for several months, and some are never confirmed. For each nomination covered by this report and confirmed in the 113 th Congress, the report provides the number of days between nomination and confirmation (\"days to confirm\"). The mean (average) number of days elapsed between nomination and confirmation was 123.9. The median number of days elapsed was 104.0. Under Senate Rules, nominations not acted on by the Senate at the end of a session of Congress (or before a recess of 30 days) are returned to the President. The Senate, by unanimous consent, often waives this rule—although not always. This report measures the \"days to confirm\" from the date of receipt of the resubmitted nomination, not the original. Agency profiles in this report are organized in two parts: (1) a table listing the organization's full-time PAS positions as of the end of the 113 th Congress and (2) a table listing appointment action for vacant positions during the 113 th Congress. As mentioned earlier, data for these tables were collected from several authoritative sources. As noted, some agencies had no nomination activity during this time. In each agency profile, the first of the two tables identifies, as of the end of the 113 th Congress, each full-time PAS position in the organization and its pay level. For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule, which, as of January 2014, ranged from level I ($201,700) for Cabinet-level offices to level V ($147,200) for lower-ranked positions. The second table, the appointment action table, provides, in chronological order, information concerning each nomination. It shows the name of the nominee, position involved, date of nomination, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation, if confirmed. It also notes actions other than confirmation (i.e., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President). The appointment action tables with more than one nominee to a position also list statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. Each nomination action table provides the average days to confirm in two ways: mean and median. Although the mean is a more familiar measure, it may be influenced by outliers, or extreme values, in the data. The median, by contrast, does not tend to be influenced by outliers. In other words, a nomination that took an extraordinarily long time might cause a significant change in the mean, but the median would be unaffected. Examining both numbers offers more information with which to assess the central tendency of the data. Appendix A provides two tables. Table A-1 relists all appointment action identified in this report and is organized alphabetically by the appointee's last name. Table entries identify the agency to which each individual was appointed, position title, nomination date, date confirmed or other final action, and duration count for confirmed nominations. In the final two rows, the table includes the mean and median values for the \"days to confirm\" column. Table A-2 provides summary data on the appointments identified in this report and is organized by agency type, including independent executive agencies, agencies in the EOP, multilateral organizations, and agencies in the legislative branch. The table summarizes the number of positions, nominations submitted, individual nominees, confirmations, nominations returned, and nominations withdrawn for each agency grouping. It also includes mean and median values for the number of days taken to confirm nominations in each category. Appendix B provides a list of department abbreviations. Appendix A.

The list does not include covert actions or numerous occurrences in which U.S. forces have been stationed abroad since World War II in occupation forces or for participation in mutual security organizations, base agreements, or routine military assistance or training operations. Because of differing judgments over the actions to be included, other lists may include more or fewer instances. These cases vary greatly in size of operation, legal authorization, and significance. The number of troops involved ranges from a few sailors or marines landed to protect American lives and property to hundreds of thousands in Korea and Vietnam and millions in World War II. Some actions were of short duration, and some lasted a number of years. In some examples, a military officer acted without authorization; some actions were conducted solely under the President's powers as Chief Executive or Commander in Chief; other instances were authorized by Congress in some fashion. In 11 separate cases (listed in bold-face type ) the United States formally declared war against foreign nations. For most of the instances listed, however, the status of the action under domestic or international law has not been addressed. Most occurrences listed since 1980 are summaries of U.S. military deployments reported to Congress by the President as a result of the War Powers Resolution. Several of these presidential reports are summaries of activities related to an ongoing operation previously reported. Note that inclusion in this list does not connote either legality or level of significance of the instance described. This report covers uses of U.S. military force abroad from 1798 to December 2018.

It was compiled in part from various older lists and is intended primarily to provide a rough survey of past U.S. military ventures abroad, without reference to the magnitude of the given instance noted. The listing often contains references, especially from 1980 forward, to continuing military deployments, especially U.S. military participation in multinational operations associated with NATO or the United Nations. Most of these post-1980 instances are summaries based on presidential reports to Congress related to the War Powers Resolution. A comprehensive commentary regarding any of the instances listed is not undertaken here. The instances differ greatly in number of forces, purpose, extent of hostilities, and legal authorization. Eleven times in its history, the United States has formally declared war against foreign nations. These 11 U.S. war declarations encompassed five separate wars: the war with Great Britain declared in 1812; the war with Mexico declared in 1846; the war with Spain declared in 1898; the First World War, during which the United States declared war with Germany and with Austria-Hungary during 1917; and World War II, during which the United States declared war against Japan, Germany, and Italy in 1941, and against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania in 1942. Some of the instances were extended military engagements that might be considered undeclared wars. These include the Undeclared Naval War with France from 1798 to 1800; the First Barbary War from 1801 to 1805; the Second Barbary War of 1815; the Korean War of 1950-1953; the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1973; the Persian Gulf War of 1991; global actions against foreign terrorists after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States; and the war with Iraq in 2003. With the exception of the Korean War, all of these conflicts received congressional authorization in some form short of a formal declaration of war. Other, more recent instances have often involved deployment of U.S. military forces as part of a multinational operation associated with NATO or the United Nations. The majority of the instances listed prior to World War II were brief Marine Corps or Navy actions to protect U.S. citizens or promote U.S. interests. A number were engagements against pirates or bandits. Covert operations, domestic disaster relief, and routine alliance stationing and training exercises are not included here, nor are the Civil and Revolutionary Wars and the continual use of U.S. military units in the exploration, settlement, and pacification of the western part of the United States.

It is based on our report, which is being released today. Because State is the lead U.S. foreign affairs agency, its personnel require certain knowledge, skills, and abilities to equip them to address the global security threats and challenges facing the United States--including the threat of Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, environmental degradation, nuclear proliferation, and failed states. In fiscal years 2006 through 2010, State's funding for training personnel grew by about 62 percent, and the department requested more than $266 million in fiscal year 2011 for programs providing training in professional skills such as foreign language proficiency, area studies, information technology, consular duties, and others needed for the conduct of foreign relations. State's Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the primary training provider for the department's more than 66,000 Foreign Service, civil service, and locally employed staff worldwide. Our prior work has identified staffing and foreign language shortfalls at State, including challenges the department has faced in filling positions at the mid-level in particular, and in attracting qualified personnel for some hardship posts. The department is currently in the midst of what it has called the most challenging military-to-civilian transition in U.S. history in Iraq, one of the posts of greatest hardship where State personnel serve. Recent departmental initiatives--in particular, \"Diplomacy 3.0,\" a multiyear effort launched in March 2009 with a primary aim of increasing the size of State's Foreign Service by 25 percent and the civil service by 13 percent--have underscored the importance of training to equip personnel to fulfill State's leadership role in world affairs and to advance and defend U.S. interests abroad. Today's testimony will discuss State's purpose and structure for training personnel, including leadership, management, professional, and area studies training, contributing to diplomatic readiness of State's Foreign Service and civil service personnel and locally employed staff overseas. It will also discuss the extent to which State's personnel training incorporates elements of effective federal training programs. We found that State has taken many steps to incorporate the interrelated elements of an effective training program--planning, design, implementation, and evaluation--into its training for personnel, but the department's strategic approach to workforce training could be improved in several key areas. Specifically, we identified five areas where State can improve its training. First, State lacks a comprehensive training needs assessment process incorporating all bureaus and posts. Second, State developed guidance for employees about training opportunities, career paths, and how training can help employees attain career goals, but the guidance does not provide complete and accurate information. Third, State lacks a data collection and analysis plan for evaluating training, and thus cannot be assured that proper practices and procedures are systematically and comprehensively applied. Fourth, State could not sufficiently demonstrate consistent and appropriate support for training, because the department does not track detailed information on training cost and delivery that would allow for an analysis and comparison of employees in different groups, bureaus, regions, or posts. Lastly, State performance measures for training generally do not fully address training goals, and are generally output-rather than outcome-oriented."}

Perkins have been the main federal laws authorized to support the development of career and technical education (CTE) programs aimed at students in secondary and postsecondary education. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins Act; P.L. 109-270 ), the most recent reauthorization of the federal CTE law, was passed in 2006 and authorized appropriations through FY2012. The authorization of appropriations was extended through FY2013 under the General Education Provisions Act, and the Perkins Act has continued to receive appropriations through annual appropriations acts through FY2017. During the 114 th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce marked up and unanimously reported the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21 st Century Act ( H.R. 5587 ), which would have provided for a comprehensive six-year reauthorization of the Perkins Act. H.R. 5587 was subsequently passed by the House of Representatives on September 13, 2016, by a vote of 405-5. No further action was taken on the bill. In the 115 th Congress, a new act, also named the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21 st Century Act ( H.R. 2353 ), was introduced and marked up by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. H.R. 2353 is similar to H.R. 5587 from the 114 th Congress but contains several modified provisions. The committee reported the bill unanimously on May 17, 2017. H.R. 2353 was passed by the House under suspension of the rules on June 22, 2017. H.R. 2353 would authorize appropriations through FY2023. This report does not attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of H.R. 2353 . Rather, it provides an overview of the primary changes that would be made by H.R. 2353 .

", "completion": "response:\nSince 1984, a number of acts named after former Congressman Carl D. Perkins have been the main federal laws authorized to support the development of career and technical education (CTE) programs aimed at students in secondary and postsecondary education. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins Act; P.L. 109-270), the most recent reauthorization of the federal CTE law, was passed in 2006 and authorized appropriations through FY2012. The authorization of appropriations was extended through FY2013 under the General Education Provisions Act, and the Perkins Act has continued to receive appropriations through annual appropriations acts through FY2017. During the 114th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce marked up and unanimously reported the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 5587), which would have provided for a comprehensive reauthorization of the Perkins Act. H.R. 5587 was subsequently passed by the House of Representatives on September 13, 2016, by a vote of 405-5. No further action was taken on the bill. In the 115th Congress, a new act, also named the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 2353), was introduced and marked up by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. H.R. 2353 is similar to H.R. 5587 from the 114th Congress but contains several modified provisions. The committee reported the bill unanimously on May 17, 2017. H.R. 2353 was passed by the House under suspension of the rules on June 22, 2017. H.R. 2353 would make a number of major changes to current law. Some of these include repealing the Tech Prep program, which provided funds to consortia of secondary and postsecondary CTE providers but has not been funded since FY2010; gradually raising total authorized appropriation levels for CTE, reaching a total of $1.21 billion in FY2023, compared to the FY2017 actual appropriations of $1.12 billion; introducing a change to the state allocation formula that would require that states receive an allocation of no less than 90% of their previous year's allocation starting in FY2021; permitting states to reserve up to 15% of their Basic State Grants funds for innovative CTE activities in rural areas or areas with higher numbers or concentrations of CTE students; allowing states to set their own annual targets on the core indicators of performance at both the secondary and postsecondary education levels without approval from the Secretary of Education; replacing the local plan required from CTE providers with a comprehensive needs assessment meant to align the CTE programs being offered with local workforce needs; removing the ability of the Secretary of Education to withhold state funds due to a lack of improved performance; and revising and introducing a number of new definitions, including common definitions for terms already defined in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. This report highlights the key provisions in H.R. 2353 and explains the major differences between it and current law."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThis report provides a brief outline of the FY2015 annual appropriations measure for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its enactment by the 114 th Congress. It serves as a complement to CRS Report R43796, Department of Homeland Security: FY2015 Appropriations . The first portion of this report outlines the legislative chronology of major events in the 114 th Congress related to funding the department for FY2015. The second portion provides an overview of DHS appropriations sought by the Administration and proposed by Congress at various stages of the FY2015 process. Prior to the 114 th Congress, Congress had not enacted an FY2015 annual appropriations bill for DHS. As FY2014 drew to a close, senior appropriators indicated they would pursue an omnibus appropriations package in the lame duck session of the 113 th Congress, rather than stand-alone appropriations bills. The President signed an interim continuing resolution for FY2015 into law prior to the end of the fiscal year. After enactment of a second and third short-term continuing resolution, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, was signed into law as P.L. 113-235 on December 16, 2014. Congress did not include full annual funding for DHS as part of the package, but Division L of P.L. 113-235 provided an extension of continuing appropriations for the department through February 27, 2015. The following descriptions reflect only the major actions taken on FY2015 homeland security appropriations in the 114 th Congress. For a more detailed description of the procedural actions taken, see CRS Report R43776, Congressional Action on FY2015 Appropriations Measures , by [author name scrubbed]. H.R. 240, an annual appropriations bill which would provide DHS $39.7 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, was introduced by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers on January 9, 2015. The bill was not reported out of committee prior to floor consideration, but an explanatory statement serving the same function as a committee report was posted on the House Appropriations Committee website the same day the bill was introduced and printed in the Congressional Record for January 13, 2015. The bill was considered under a structured rule on January 13 and 14, 2015. Under the structured rule, five amendments were made in order. Two were \"Sense of Congress\" amendments, expressing views on aspects of the Administration's immigration policy. Three would have affected the availability of funds for certain purposes that were provided by H.R. 240 , as well as in any other act in any fiscal year (these appeared as Sections 579, 580, and 581 in the House-passed bill). The first of these three was an amendment that added a general provision that would restrict the use of any federal funds for carrying out the Administration's immigration initiative of November 2014, or implementing the direction in several memoranda on prosecutorial discretion and immigration enforcement priorities that were issued in 2011 and 2012. This amendment went on to state that the prohibition would extend to future similar policies, expressed that such policies would have no legal effect and that no funds may be used to grant any federal benefit to any alien as a result of those policies. The second of these three was an amendment to prohibit any federal funds from being used to consider new, renewal, or previously denied applications for temporary relief for removal under the deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) program. The third amendment would have required, through a restriction on the use of funds, that DHS treat aliens convicted of any offense involving domestic violence, sexual abuse, child molestation, or child molestation as being among the group of aliens that are the highest priority for deportation. After adopting these five amendments, the bill passed the House on January 14, 2015, by a vote of 236-191. The Senate proceeded to consider H.R. 240 on February 25, 2015. On February 27, 2015, the Senate adopted an amendment that was functionally the same as H.R. 240 as introduced—without the legislative text added by the five House amendments—by a vote of 66-33, then passed the Senate-amended bill by a vote of 68-31. On February 27, 2015, a three-week extension of the continuing resolution funding DHS ( H.J.Res. 35 ) did not pass the House by a vote of 203-224. Roughly three hours later, the Senate amended a House bill ( H.R. 33 ) to extend the continuing resolution through March 6, 2015, and passed the amended version by a voice vote. The House agreed to the Senate amendment by a vote of 357-60, and the President signed the bill into law as P.L. 114-3 that night. On March 3, 2015, the House voted 257-167 to approve the Senate version of H.R. 240 . On March 4, 2015, H.R. 240 was signed into law as P.L. 114-4 . Generally, the homeland security appropriations bill includes all annual appropriations provided for DHS, providing resources to every departmental component. Table 2 includes a summary of funding included in the FY2014 regular DHS appropriations bill, the Administration's FY2015 appropriations request, the House- and Senate-reported FY2015 DHS appropriations bills, and P.L. 114-4 broken down by title. The various components of DHS vary widely in the size of their appropriated budgets. Table 3 and Figure 1 show DHS's new discretionary budget authority for FY2015 broken down by component, from largest to smallest appropriations request. Total discretionary appropriations in Table 3 do not include resources provided through adjustments under the Budget Control Act (BCA) in the individual component lines. These are accounted for separately from the total discretionary appropriations and are displayed at the bottom of the table. As the table and figure reflect new discretionary budget authority, neither appropriated mandatory spending nor rescissions of prior-year budget authority are reflected in the component totals. In Figure 1 , the first column of numbers shows budget authority provided in P.L. 113-76 , which included the FY2014 appropriations for DHS: resources available under the adjustments to the discretionary spending limits provided pursuant to the BCA are shown in black. The second column shows a similar breakdown for the FY2015 request, and the third and fourth columns show a similar breakdown of the FY2015 House- and Senate-reported bills. The fifth column shows the levels that provided under P.L. 114-4 . ", "completion": "response:\nThis report provides a brief outline of the FY2015 annual appropriations measure for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its enactment by the 114th Congress. It serves as a complement to CRS Report R43796, Department of Homeland Security: FY2015 Appropriations. The Administration requested $38.3 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2015. In the 113th Congress, the House Appropriations Committee reported an annual appropriations measure (H.R. 4903) that would have provided $39.2 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, and the Senate Appropriations Committee reported a measure (S. 2534) that would have provided $39.0 billion. Neither bill received floor consideration in the 113th Congress. As no DHS annual appropriation had been enacted by the end of FY2014, the department operated under a continuing resolution for the first several months of FY2015. Annual appropriations for DHS were not included in P.L. 113-235, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, which extended the continuing resolution—slated to expire December 17, 2014—through February 27, 2015. With the beginning of the 114th Congress, both House- and Senate-reported FY2015 annual homeland security appropriations bills were no longer available for action. H.R. 240, a new FY2015 annual homeland security appropriations bill, was introduced on January 9, 2015, and considered in the House the following week under a structured rule that allowed five immigration policy-related amendments. After adopting these five amendments, the bill passed the House on January 14, 2015. On February 27, the Senate passed an amended H.R. 240 without the legislative text added by the House amendments. After the House did not pass a three-week extension of the continuing resolution, the Senate and House passed a one week extension of the continuing resolution to avoid a lapse in annual appropriations for DHS. On March 3, 2015, the House voted to approve the Senate version of H.R. 240. The bill was signed into law on March 4, 2015, as P.L. 114-4. As enacted, the bill provided $39.7 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This report will not be updated."}

The Senate passed S. 2012 on April 20, 2016. On May 25, 2016, the House passed an amended version of S. 2012 which contains the text of H.R. 8 , as well as the text of several other energy and natural resources-related bills. The following day, the House moved to insist upon its amendment, and to appoint conferees to resolve the differences in S. 2012 . On July 12, the Senate agreed to the request for a conference, and appointed conferees. In addition to energy policy provisions, both versions of S. 2012 contain many natural resources and environmental provisions including provisions on fish and wildlife recreation and federal land conveyances. The Senate version includes permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and reauthorization of EPA's Brownfields Program, while the House version includes provisions on National Forest management and drought relief. The House-passed bill would have eliminated restrictions on the export of U.S.-produced crude oil. However, this provision was included in the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 114-113 ). The House-passed bill also includes provisions on the physical security of the electric grid. Two of these provisions—on critical electric infrastructure security and a strategic transformer reserve—were included in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act ( P.L. 114-94 ).

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the primary source of federal aid to elementary and secondary education. Title I-A is the largest program in the ESEA, funded at $14.9 billion for FY2016. Title I-A is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending elementary and secondary schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) determines Title I-A grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on four separate funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). The ESEA was comprehensively reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ) on December 10, 2015. The ESSA made few changes to the Title I-A formulas. These changes took effect in FY2017. This report provides final FY2016 state grant amounts under each of the four formulas used to determine Title I-A grants. For a general overview of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44164, ESEA Title I-A Formulas: In Brief , by [author name scrubbed]. For a more detailed discussion of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44461, Allocation of Funds Under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. Under Title I-A, funds are allocated to LEAs via state educational agencies (SEAs) using the four Title I-A formulas. Annual appropriations bills specify portions of each year's Title I-A appropriation to be allocated to LEAs and states under each of the formulas. In FY2016, about 43% of Title I-A appropriations were allocated through the Basic Grants formula, 9% through the Concentration Grants formula, and 24% each through the Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas. Once funds reach LEAs, the amounts allocated under the four formulas are combined and used jointly. For each formula, a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a \"formula child count,\" consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children in poor families, by an \"expenditure factor\" based on state average per pupil expenditures for public elementary and secondary education. In some formulas, additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor. These maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula, taking into account a variety of state and LEA minimum grant provisions. In general, LEAs must have a minimum number of formula children and/or a minimum formula child rate to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific Title I-A formula. Some LEAs may qualify for a grant under only one formula, while other LEAs may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas. Under three of the formulas—Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants—funds are initially calculated at the LEA level. State grants are the total of allocations for all LEAs in the state, adjusted for state minimum grant provisions. Under EFIG, grants are first calculated for each state overall and then are subsequently suballocated to LEAs within the state using a different formula. Final FY2016 grants included in this report were calculated by ED. The percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas was calculated by CRS for each state by dividing the total grant received by the total amount allocated under each respective formula. Table 1 provides each state's grant amount and percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas for FY2016. Total Title I-A grants, calculated by summing the state level grant for each of the four formulas, are also shown in Table 1 . Overall, California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount ($1.8 billion) and, as a result, the largest percentage share (11.98%) of Title I-A grants. Wyoming received the smallest total Title I-A grant amount ($34.8 million) and, as a result, the smallest percentage share (0.24%) of Title I-A grants. In general, grant amounts for states vary among formulas due to the different allocation amounts for the formulas. For example, the Basic Grant formula receives a greater share of overall Title I-A appropriations than the Concentration Grant formula, so states generally receive higher estimated grant amounts under the Basic Grant formula than under the Concentration Grant formula. Among states, Title I-A grant amounts and the percentage shares of funds vary due to the different characteristics of each state. For example, Texas has a much larger population of children included in the formula calculations than North Carolina and, therefore, received a higher estimated grant amount and larger share of Title I-A funds. Within a state, the percentage share of funds allocated may vary by formula as certain formulas are more favorable to certain types of states (e.g., EFIG is generally more favorable to states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their LEAs). If a state's share of a given Title I-A formula exceeds its share of overall Title I-A funds, this is generally an indication that this particular formula is more favorable to the state than formulas for which the state's share of funds is below its overall share of Title I-A funds. For example, Florida and Nevada received a substantially higher percentage share of Targeted Grants than of overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Targeted Grants formula is more favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be. At the same time, both states received a smaller percentage share of Basic Grants than of overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Basic Grants formula is less favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be. In states that received a minimum grant under all four formulas (Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming), the shares under the Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas are greater than under the Basic Grants or Concentration Grants formulas, due to higher state minimums under these formulas. If a state received the minimum grant under a given Title I-A formula, the grant amount is denoted with an asterisk (*) in Table 1 .", "completion": "response:\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was comprehensively reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95) on December 10, 2015.

Thus, for some states, certain formulas are more favorable than others. This report provides final FY2016 state grant amounts under each of the four formulas used to determine Title I-A grants.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe financial crisis that began in 2007 spread and gathered intensity in 2008, despite the efforts of central banks and regulators to restore calm. By early 2009, the financial system and the global economy appeared to be locked in a descending spiral, and the primary focus of policy became the prevention of a prolonged downturn on the order of the Great Depression. The volume and variety of negative financial news, and the seeming impotence of policy responses, has raised new questions about the origins of financial crises and the market mechanisms by which they are contained or propagated. Just as the economic impact of financial market failures in the 1930s remains an active academic subject, it is likely that the causes of the current crisis will be debated for decades to come. This report sets out in tabular form a number of the factors that have been identified as causes of the crisis. The left column of Table 1 below summarizes the causal role of each such factor. The next column presents a brief rejoinder to that argument. The right-hand column contains a reference for further reading. Where text is given in quotation marks, the reference in the right column is the source, unless otherwise specified.", "completion": "response:\nThe current financial crisis began in August 2007, when financial stability replaced inflation as the Federal Reserve's chief concern. The roots of the crisis go back much further, and there are various views on the fundamental causes. It is generally accepted that credit standards in U.S. mortgage lending were relaxed in the early 2000s, and that rising rates of delinquency and foreclosures delivered a sharp shock to a range of U.S. financial institutions. Beyond that point of agreement, however, there are many questions that will be debated by policymakers and academics for decades. Why did the financial shock from the housing market downturn prove so difficult to contain? Why did the tools the Fed used successfully to limit damage to the financial system from previous shocks (the Asian crises of 1997-1998, the stock market crashes of 1987 and 2000-2001, the junk bond debacle in 1989, the savings and loan crisis, 9/11, and so on) fail to work this time? If we accept that the origins are in the United States, why were so many financial systems around the world swept up in the panic? To what extent were long-term developments in financial markets to blame for the instability? Derivatives markets, for example, were long described as a way to spread financial risk more efficiently, so that market participants could bear only those risks they understood. Did derivatives, and other risk management techniques, actually increase risk and instability under crisis conditions? Was there too much reliance on computer models of market performance? Did those models reflect only the post-WWII period, which may now come to be viewed not as a typical 60-year period, suitable for use as a baseline for financial forecasts, but rather as an unusually favorable period that may not recur? Did government actions inadvertently create the conditions for crisis? Did regulators fail to use their authority to prevent excessive risk-taking, or was their jurisdiction too limited and/or compartmentalized? The multiple roots of the crisis are mirrored in the policy response. Two bills in the 111th Congress—H.R. 4173, passed by the House on December 11, 2009, and Senator Dodd's Restoring American Financial Stability Act, as ordered reported by the Senate Banking Committee on March 22, 2010—address many of the purported causal factors across the entire financial system. The bills address systemic risk, too-big-to-fail, prudential supervision, hedge funds, derivatives, payments systems, credit rating agencies, securitization, and consumer financial protection.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nIn addition to the Senate and House of Representatives, the legislative branch bill typically funds Joint Items, including the Joint Economic Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, Office of the Attending Physician, and Office of Congressional Accessibility Services; Capitol Police; Office of Compliance (OOC); Congressional Budget Office (CBO); Architect of the Capitol (AOC); Library of Congress (LOC), including the Congressional Research Service (CRS); Government Publishing Office (GPO); Government Accountability Office (GAO); and Open World Leadership Center. Table 1 provides information on the enacted funding levels provided for the legislative branch from FY2008 to FY2019. The table includes annual and supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and the FY2013 sequestration. Figure 1 shows the distribution of budget authority across the legislative branch in FY2019. Table 2 provides information on funding levels for the Senate, House of Representatives, and legislative branch agencies in recent years as well as the requested, House-passed, Senate-passed, and enacted levels for FY2019. The FY2019 legislative branch budget request of $4.960 billion was submitted on February 12, 2018, prior to the enactment of FY2018 funding on March 23, 2018. Agency assessments for FY2019 may subsequently have been revised—for example, to account for items funded or not funded in the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Subsequent discussions may vary from the levels or language included in the budget request due to this timing. By law, the President includes the legislative branch request in the annual budget submission without change. The House passed H.R. 5895 , which contained funding for the legislative branch, on June 8, 2018. The Senate passed H.R. 5895 , as amended ( S.Amdt. 2910 ), on June 25, 2018. The Senate agreed to the conference report ( H.Rept. 115-929 ) on H.R. 5895 on September 12, 2018. The House agreed to the conference report on September 13, 2018. H.R. 5895 was signed into law on September 21, 2018 ( P.L. 115-244 ; the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019). The President has no formal role in the development of the legislative branch budget request, even though it is included in the President's annual budget request documents. By long-standing law and practice, the legislative branch request and any supplemental requests are submitted to the President and included in the budget without change. While the executive branch budget submissions generally involve interaction between an agency and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the legislative branch requests do not. The executive branch does not review or maintain documentation in support of the legislative branch requests. Since FY1976, the legislative branch as a proportion of total discretionary budget authority has averaged approximately 0.40%. The maximum level, 0.48%, was in FY1995 and the minimum, 0.31%, was in FY2009. Discretionary budget authority is provided and controlled by the annual appropriations acts. Since FY1976, the legislative branch as a proportion of total budget authority has averaged 0.17%. The maximum level, 0.23%, was in FY1977, and the minimum, 0.11%, was in FY2017. Total budget authority includes both budget authority controlled by the annual appropriations acts and budget authority controlled by previous laws, including entitlements. No, salaries for Members of Congress are neither funded nor increased in the legislative branch bill. Member salaries have been included as mandatory spending since FY1983, and the amount of potential Member pay adjustments is calculated pursuant to the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, which established a formula based on changes in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The adjustment automatically takes effect unless (1) Congress statutorily prohibits the adjustment; (2) Congress statutorily revises the adjustment; or (3) the annual base pay adjustment of General Schedule (GS) federal employees is established at a rate less than the scheduled increase for Members, in which case the percentage adjustment for Member pay is automatically lowered to match the percentage adjustment in GS base pay. Members of Congress last received a pay adjustment in January 2009. Since then, the compensation for most Senators, Representatives, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico has been $174,000. The maximum potential January 2019 member pay adjustment was 2.3%, or $4,000. The FY2019 act included a provision prohibiting this adjustment. As in prior years, the Member pay adjustment prohibition was included in the legislation as introduced, and no separate votes were held on the pay issue. Although discussion of Member pay is often associated with appropriations bills, these bills do not contain language funding or increasing Member pay, and a prohibition on the automatic annual Member pay adjust ments could be included in any bill, or be introduced as a separate bill. For a list of the laws that have previously contained provisions prohibiting the annual pay adjustments, see \"Table 3. Legislative Vehicles Used for Pay Prohibitions, Enacted Dates, and Pay Language\" in CRS Report 97-1011, Salaries of Members of Congress: Recent Actions and Historical Tables , by Ida A. Brudnick. In contrast, the salaries and benefits for legislative branch employees are provided by the legislative branch appropriations acts, although they generally do not address pay adjustments. The House and Senate both consider funding levels for the legislative branch agencies and joint entities. By long-standing tradition, however, the House bill does not propose funding levels for Senate items, including the account that funds the Senate and the Senate office buildings account within the Architect of the Capitol. Similarly, the Senate does not comment on House items, including the account that funds the House or the House office buildings account within the Architect of the Capitol. The House, Senate, and conference reports on legislative branch appropriations bills regularly contain language illustrating the deference of each chamber to the internal practices of the other. If comparing the House and Senate bill totals, or the total provided to the Architect of the Capitol at different stages of consideration, adjustments may be necessary to address any omissions due to this practice.", "completion": "response:\nThis report responds to frequently asked questions about legislative branch appropriations. Frequently asked questions include the items that are funded within this bill; development, presentation, and consideration of the legislative branch budget requests; the legislative branch budget in historical perspective; and recent actions. The House and Senate considered FY2019 legislative branch funding during 2018: The FY2019 legislative branch budget request of $4.960 billion was submitted on February 12, 2018. The budget request levels were developed prior to the enactment of full-year appropriations for FY2018. Agency assessments for FY2019 may subsequently have been revised—for example, to account for items funded or not funded in the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the primary source of federal aid to K-12 education. Title I-A is the largest program in the ESEA, funded at $14.4 billion for FY2015. Title I-A is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending pre-kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) determines Title I-A grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on four separate funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). The ESEA was comprehensively reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ) on December 10, 2015. The ESSA made few changes to the Title I-A formulas. Changes to the Title I-A formulas under the ESSA will take effect beginning in FY2017. This report provides final FY2015 state grant amounts under each of the four formulas used to determine Title I-A grants. For a general overview of the Title I-A formulas see CRS Report R44164, ESEA Title I-A Formulas: In Brief , by [author name scrubbed]. For a more detailed discussion of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report RL34721, Elementary and Secondary Education Act: An Analytical Review of the Allocation Formulas , by [author name scrubbed]. Under Title I-A, funds are allocated to LEAs via state educational agencies (SEAs) using four different allocation formulas specified in statute: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). Annual appropriations bills specify portions of each year's Title I-A appropriation to be allocated to LEAs and states under each of these formulas. In FY2015, about 45% of Title I-A appropriations were allocated through the Basic Grants formula, 9% through the Concentration Grants formula, and 23% through each of the Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas. Once funds reach LEAs, the amounts allocated under the four formulas are combined and used jointly. For each formula, a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a \"formula child count,\" consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children in poor families, by an \"expenditure factor\" based on state average per pupil expenditures for public K-12 education. In some formulas, additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor. These maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula, taking into account a variety of state and LEA minimum grant provisions. In general, LEAs must have a minimum number of formula children and/or a minimum formula child rate to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific Title I-A formula. Some LEAs may qualify for a grant under only one formula, while other LEAs may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas. Under three of the formulas—Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants—funds are initially calculated at the LEA level. State grants are the total of allocations for all LEAs in the state, adjusted for state minimum grant provisions. Under EFIG, grants are first calculated for each state overall and then are subsequently suballocated to LEAs within the state using a different formula. Final FY2015 grants included in this report were calculated by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). The percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas was calculated by CRS for each state by dividing the total grant received by the total amount allocated under each respective formula. Table 1 provides each state's grant amount and percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas for FY2015. Total Title I-A grants, calculated by summing the state level grant for each of the four formulas, are also shown in Table 1 . Overall, California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount ($1.7 billion) and, as a result, the largest percentage share (11.81%) of Title I-A grants. Wyoming received the smallest total Title I-A grant amount ($33.1 million) and, as a result, the smallest percentage share (0.23%) of Title I-A grants. In general, grant amounts for states vary among formulas due to the different allocation amounts for the formulas. For example, the Basic Grant formula receives a greater share of overall Title I-A appropriations than the Concentration Grant formula, so states generally receive higher estimated grant amounts under the Basic Grant formula than under the Concentration Grant formula. Among states, Title I-A grant amounts and the percentage shares of funds vary due to the different characteristics of each state. For example, Texas has a much larger population of children included in the formula calculations than North Carolina and, therefore, receives a higher estimated grant amount and larger share of Title I-A funds. Within a state, the percentage share of funds allocated may vary by formula, as certain formulas are more favorable to certain types of states (e.g., EFIG is generally more favorable to states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their LEAs). If a state's share of a given Title I-A formula exceeds its share of overall Title I-A funds, this is generally an indication that this particular formula is more favorable to the state than formulas for which the state's share of funds is below its overall share of Title I-A funds. For example, New York and Nevada received a substantially higher percentage share of Targeted Grants than of their overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Targeted Grant formula is more favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be. At the same time, both states received a smaller percentage share of Basic Grants than of their overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Basic Grant formula is less favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be. In states that receive a minimum grant under all four formulas (North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont), the shares under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas are greater than under the Basic or Concentration Grant formulas, due to higher state minimums under these formulas. All states receiving a minimum grant under any of the four Title I-A formulas are denoted with an asterisk (*) in Table 1 .", "completion": "response:\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was comprehensively reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95) on December 10, 2015.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has taken steps to establish an organizational culture and structure conducive to fraud risk management in its disability programs, but its new antifraud office is still evolving. In recent years, SSA instituted mandatory antifraud training, established a centralized antifraud office to coordinate and oversee the agency's fraud risk management activities, and communicated the importance of antifraud efforts. These actions are generally consistent with GAO's Fraud Risk Framework, a set of leading practices that can serve as a guide for program managers to use when developing antifraud efforts in a strategic way. However, SSA's new antifraud office, the Office of Anti-Fraud Programs (OAFP), faced challenges establishing itself as the coordinating body for the agency's antifraud initiatives. For example, the OAFP has had multiple acting leaders, but SSA recently appointed a permanent leader of OAFP to provide accountability for the agency's antifraud activities. SSA has taken steps to identify and address fraud risks in its disability programs, but it has not yet comprehensively assessed these fraud risks or developed a strategic approach to help ensure its antifraud activities effectively mitigate those risks. Over the last year, SSA gathered information about fraud risks, but these efforts generally have not been systematic and did not assess the likelihood, impact, or significance of all risks that were identified. SSA also has several prevention and detection activities in place to address known fraud risks in its disability programs such as fraud examination units, which review disability claims to help detect fraud perpetrated by third parties. However, SSA has not developed and documented an overall antifraud strategy that aligns its antifraud activities to its fraud risks. Leading practices call for federal program managers to conduct a fraud risk assessment and develop a strategy to address identified fraud risks. Without conducting a fraud risk assessment that aligns with leading practices and developing an antifraud strategy, SSA's disability programs may remain vulnerable to new fraud schemes, and SSA will not be able to effectively prioritize its antifraud activities. SSA monitors its antifraud activities through the OAFP and its National Anti-Fraud Committee (NAFC), which serves as an advisory board to the OAFP, but the agency does not have effective performance metrics to evaluate the effect of such activities. The OAFP has responsibility for monitoring SSA's antifraud activities and establishing performance and outcome-oriented goals for them. It collects metrics to inform reports about its antifraud initiatives, and the NAFC receives regular updates about antifraud initiatives. However, the quality of the metrics varies across initiatives and some initiatives do not have metrics. Of the 17 initiatives listed in SSA's 2015 report on antifraud initiatives, 10 had metrics that did not focus on outcomes, and 4 did not have any metrics. For example, SSA lacks a metric to help monitor the effectiveness of its fraud examination units. Leading practices in fraud risk management call for managers to monitor and evaluate antifraud initiatives with a focus on measuring outcomes. Without outcome-oriented performance metrics, SSA may not be able to evaluate its antifraud activities, review progress, and determine whether changes are necessary."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Census Bureau's release of the first figures from the 2010 Census on December 21, 2010, shifted 12 seats among 18 states for the 113 th Congress (beginning in January 2013). Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania each lost one seat; New York and Ohio each lost two seats. Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington each gained one seat; Florida gained two seats, and Texas gained four seats. The reapportionment of House seats in 2010 was based on an apportionment population that is different from the actual resident population of each state. For apportionment purposes since 1970 (with the exception of 1980), the Census Bureau has added to each state's resident population the foreign-based, overseas military and federal employees and their dependents, who are from the state but not residing therein at the time of the census. In 2010, these additional persons increased the census count for the 50 states by 1,042,523, a little less than twice the number in 2000. If the foreign-based military and federal employees had not been included in the counts, there would have been no change in the 2010 apportionment of seats, although the order of seat assignment would have changed. The reapportionment process for the House relies on rounding principles, but the actual procedure involves computing a \"priority list\" of seat assignments for the states. The Constitution allocates the first 50 seats because each state must have at least one Representative. A priority list assigns the remaining 385 seats for a total of 435. Table 2 displays the end of the \"priority list\" that would be used to allocate Representatives based on the 2012 Census estimates of the state populations as of July 1. The law only provides for 435 seats in the House, but the table illustrates not only the last seats assigned by the apportionment formula (ending at 435), but the states that would just miss getting additional representation. The apportionment counts transmitted by the Census Bureau to the President (who then sends them to Congress) are considered final. Thus, most states that lost seats in the 113 th Congress had only one possible option for retaining them: urge Congress to increase the size of the House. Any other option such as changing the formula used in the computations, or changing the components of the apportionment population (such as omitting the foreign-based military and federal civilian employees) might only affect a small number of states if the House stays at 435 seats. As noted above, the 435-seat limit was imposed in 1929 by 46 Stat. 21, 26-27. Altering the size of the House would require a new law setting a different limit. Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution establishes a minimum House size (one Representative for each state), and a maximum House size (one Representative for every 30,000, or 10,306 based on the 2010 Census). In 2013, a House size of 468 would be necessary to prevent states from losing seats they held from the 108 th to the 112 th Congresses, but, by retaining seats through an increase in the House size, other states would also have their delegations become larger. At a House size of 468, California's delegation size, for example, would be 56 instead of 53 seats. The apportionment figures released on December 21, 2010, are made up of three components: total resident population figures for the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the foreign-based military and overseas federal employees allocated to each state and DC, and the sum of these numbers (excluding DC), which becomes the apportionment population. These numbers (minus DC) are all that is needed to reapportion the House, but most states need figures for very small geographic areas in order to draw new legislative and congressional districts. The Census Bureau must provide small-area population totals to the legislatures and governors of each state by one year after the census (e.g., April 1, 2011). The Census Bureau data delivered by April 1, 2011 (some states started receiving the information in February 2011), are often referred to as the P.L. 94-171 program data (89 Stat. 1023). This program provides, to each state, information from the 2010 Census. As such, the information is very limited—including age, race, and Hispanic origin. No other demographic information that might be useful to the persons constructing political jurisdictions, such as income or employment status, is available in the P.L. 94-171 data. Such data, however, are available from the results of the American Community Survey for geographic areas with populations as small as 20,000 persons. Census data are usually reported by political jurisdictions (states, cities, counties, and towns), and within political jurisdictions by special Census geography (such as Census designated places, tracts, block numbering areas, and blocks). The P.L. 94-171 program allows states, which chose to participate in it (49 in 2010), to request Census data by certain nontraditional Census geography such as voting districts (precincts) and state legislative districts. These special political jurisdiction counts enable the persons drawing the district lines to assess past voting behavior when redrawing congressional and state legislative districts. In most states, redrawing congressional districts is the responsibility of the state legislature with the concurrence of the governor. In seven states, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, New Jersey, and Washington, a non-partisan or bi-partisan commission is responsible for drawing and approving the plans. Some states have explicit deadlines in law to complete their congressional districting. Most do not, so the effective deadline for the legislatures or commissions to complete their work would have been whatever deadlines were established in the states for filing for primaries for the 2012 elections. Although many states have standards mandating equal populations, compactness, contiguousness, and other goals to not split counties, towns, and cities, federal law controls the redistricting process. Other than a requirement that multi-member states cannot elect Representatives at-large (2 U.S.C. 2c) however, no federal statutory law establishes explicit standards for redistricting. The principal laws that apply are the Supreme Court decisions mandating one person, one vote and the Voting Rights Act. The fundamental federal rule governing redistricting congressional districts, one person, one vote , was promulgated by the Supreme Court in Wesberry v. Sanders (376 U.S. 7, 1964). The Court has refined that ruling in a series of cases culminating in Karcher v. Daggett (462 U.S. 725, 1983) that one person, one vote means that any population deviation among districts in a state must be justified, but the deviations from absolute equality may be permitted if the states strive to make districts more compact, respect municipal boundaries, preserve the cores of prior districts, or avoid contests between incumbents. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) applies nationwide. It prohibits states or localities from imposing a \"voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice or procedure ... in a manner which results in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race or color.\" The Supreme Court interpreted the VRA's application to redistricting in a series of cases responding, in part, to the extraordinarily complicated districts created by many states in the 1990s to maximize minority representation (beginning with Shaw v. Reno , 509 U.S. 630, 1993). The Court ended the decade by establishing new principles concerning such practices: (1) race may be considered in districting to remedy past discrimination; (2) but, states must have a compelling state interest to ignore traditional redistricting principles and \"gerrymander\" to establish majority-minority districts; (3) courts will apply \"strict scrutiny\" to such assertions that racial \"gerrymanders\" are necessary to determine whether such plans are narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest.", "completion": "response:\nOn December 21, 2010, the Commerce Department released 2010 Census population figures and the resulting reapportionment of seats in the House of Representatives.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nMembers of Congress and the public are increasingly concerned about the ability of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that the drugs sold in the United States are safe and effective. Legislators, industry, the public, and FDA scientists have raised questions about FDA's collection and release of safety data, and whether the agency has the authority and resources to ensure adequate research over the marketing life of the pharmaceutical products it regulates. In 2004, the regulatory, medical, and industry debate became very public with reports of cardiovascular hazards posed by the pain medicine Vioxx (one of several COX-2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs then on the market), and of children facing increased risk of suicidal thoughts and actions when taking certain antidepressants (such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Paxil and Zoloft). Not only was Congress asking whether the manufacturers knew of these risks while continuing to market the drug, but also whether FDA should have known of the risks and done more to protect the public. At the height of public and Congressional attention, FDA asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to \"conduct an independent assessment of the current system for evaluating and ensuring drug safety postmarketing and make recommendations to improve risk assessment, surveillance, and the safe use of drugs.\" IOM released its report in September 2006. FDA issued its response in January 2007 and noted relevant activities the agency has begun and others it has planned. Among the planned activities are those in its proposal for a reauthorization of the prescription drug user fee program (PDUFA IV). In the meantime, several Members of Congress have introduced bills to address drug safety and FDA's role in protecting the public's health. This report provides a side-by-side comparison of: Institute of Medicine: recommendations in its September 2006 report, The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public ; Food and Drug Administration: announced actions and plans to address problems identified in the IOM report; S. 468 / H.R. 788 (the Food and Drug Administration Safety Act of 2007), introduced on January 31, 2007, by Senators Grassley, Dodd, Mikulski, and Bingaman, and Representatives Tierney and Ramstad; S. 484 (the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2007), introduced on February 1, 2007, by Senators Enzi and Kennedy; and H.R. 1165 (the Swift Approval, Full Evaluation (SAFE) Drug Act), introduced on February 16, 2007, by Representative Markey. The bills and the IOM report address many of the same issues, often with similar approaches though at times with major differences. The IOM report addressed only drugs, not biological products (e.g., vaccines), in keeping with the charge FDA gave it. FDA's response to the IOM recommendations, therefore, relates to drugs, but also states that the approach to drug safety is relevant to all medical products. All the bills would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (regarding the regulation of drugs); S. 484 would also amend the Public Health Service Act (regarding the regulation of biologics). Highlighted below are a few of the more significant items regarding drug safety. S. 468 / H.R. 788 would remove the post-approval drug safety activities from FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and create a new Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics (the Center). The IOM report does not suggest that approach to strengthen FDA's postmarket activities, nor do the other pending bills. The bills and the IOM recommendations aim to strengthen FDA's ability to make sure drug manufacturers (application sponsors) appropriately design and conduct postmarket studies and disclose the results to the public. S. 468 / H.R. 788 lays out requirements that the new Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics would administer; S. 484 would achieve this with a process it calls a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS); and H.R. 1165 would allow the Secretary to require certain studies. The IOM recommended and all the bills would allow the Secretary to penalize (through civil fines, injunctions, or withdrawal of marketing approval or licensure) sponsors who do not conduct required studies or complete them on time, or who fail to report study results. The IOM report and the bills address the need for FDA authority to require pre- and postmarket studies. S. 468 alone would give FDA the authority to require that those studies compare a drug's safety and effectiveness with that of other drugs. All three bills would require a variety of drug safety activities. They differ in how to fund them. S. 468 / H.R. 788 would authorize appropriations to carry out the bill's provisions; S. 484 would rely on user fees, expanding FDA's existing authority to use such fees; and H.R. 1165 does not address funding. The IOM committee not only recommended that Congress provide \"substantially increased resources\" to FDA, but noted that all its other recommendations could not be implemented without those resources. Table 1 addresses the range of FDA drug safety activities that the IOM recommended, along with FDA's response, and activities that the bills would authorize or require. The table structure follows the 25 IOM recommendations within the five categories of organizational culture, science and expertise, regulation, communication, and resources.", "completion": "response:\nMembers of Congress and the public are increasingly concerned about the ability of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that the drugs sold in the United States are safe and effective. In November 2004, FDA asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to assess the current system for evaluating and ensuring drug safety and to make recommendations to improve risk assessment, surveillance, and the safe use of drugs. IOM released The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public in September 2006, and FDA issued its response in January 2007. The following drug safety bills have been introduced in the 110th Congress: S. 468 / H.R. 788, S. 484, and H.R. 1165. Although the legislation and the IOM report address many of the same drug safety issues, the bills differ in their treatment of FDA authority to require action and to enforce compliance, comparative effectiveness studies, and how to fund any additional agency activities. For example, S. 468 / H.R. 788 would strengthen FDA's post-approval drug safety activities by creating a new Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics. The other bills would leave these activities where they currently reside in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. All the bills would allow the FDA to penalize (through civil fines, injunctions, or withdrawal of marketing approval or licensure) drug manufacturers who did not conduct required postmarket studies or who failed to report study results. The IOM committee recommended that Congress provide substantially increased resources to FDA to bolster its drug safety activities. S. 468 / H.R. 788 would authorize appropriations to carry out the bill's provisions, S. 484 would rely on user fees, expanding FDA's existing authority to use such fees, and H.R. 1165 does not address funding."}

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), the primary agency responsible for procuring DOD's ground and air transportation fuels, buys bulk energy commodities and \"resells\" the fuel to various military customers—with a price markup to cover its cost of operation (e.g. storage, transportation, and maintenance). In order to deliver fuel as cost effectively as possible, the DESC will often provide its overseas customers with energy purchased from regional suppliers. However, the DESC generally charges all of its customers worldwide a uniform price. For example, a military unit in Iraq pays the same price for jet fuel (JP-8) as a military unit stationed in most other parts of the world. Fuels purchased by the DESC include jet, diesel, motor and aviation gasoline. The DESC also arranges contracts for direct purchase of fuels at commercial airports and contracts for supplying military posts, camps, and stations. The DESC's largest annual fuel procurement is JP-8 and JP-5 jet fuel, followed by diesel fuel. In FY2007, JP-8 represented ~50% of total DOD petroleum product purchases. Though JP-8 is used primarily by Air Force and Army aircraft, it is also used in Army tactical vehicles, for example in the Abrams M1A1/M1A2 Main Battle Tank. It also serves as a substitute for diesel fuel in other tactical vehicles. Motor gasoline is typically used by light non-tactical vehicles operated at post, camps, and stations. In Iraq, the breakdown of petroleum used by DOD in FY2007 was 81.5% jet fuel, 15.8% diesel, and 2.6% gasoline. In FY2007, the DOD's average cost for fuel ranged from $2.00 a gallon for diesel to $2.05 for JP-8 ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ). In comparison, commercial jet fuel (Jet A-1) averaged $2.17 per gallon and refiner crude oil $1.62 per gallon. As represented in Table 1 and Figure 1 , refiner crude oil is the average annual cost that a U.S. refiner would pay for a gallon of crude. The DESC reports buying fuel used in support of Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR), which includes Operation Iraqi Freedom, primarily from five suppliers ( Table 2 ). The contracts for fuel contain price escalation provisions that increase or decrease the contract award prices based on fluctuations occurring in the regional commercial markets for the same or similar fuel products. As of December 31, 2007, fuel costs from these contracts ran from $1.96 to $2.88 per gallon, except for AVGAS, a specialized fuel, which ranges from $4.98 to $5.29 per gallon. The average fuel costs between FY2003 and FY2007 (during Operation Iraqi Freedom) are shown in Table 3 . Fuel prices rose dramatically in FY2008. As shown in Table 4 , gasoline costs now ranges from $3.39 to $4.52 a gallon and diesel from $4.08 to $5.21 a gallon. Of the five companies providing fuel to the DESC for use in Iraq, one (IOTC) is based in the United States, one (Kuwait Petroleum Corp.) is the state oil company of Kuwait, and three (Petrol Ofisi, Golteks, and Tefirom) are based in Turkey. Some of these companies, such as Kuwait Petroleum Corp., International Oil Trading, and Petrol Ofisi have been among the top 100 suppliers to the Defense Logistics Agency in recent years. According to the DLA, fuels purchased from Kuwait Petroleum Corp. are transported into Iraq by Jassim Transport and Stevedoring Company. Jassim is paid on a per-truck per-day basis. Prices range from $159 -$194 a day, depending on the size of the truck and the type of fuel being transported. Fuel purchased from IOTC is transported from Jordan. The cost of fuel charged by IOTC includes shipping into Iraq. The cost of gasoline, diesel, and aviation gasoline originating from Turkey also includes shipping costs. JP-8 originating from Turkey is supplied by truck under a separate tender agreement put in place by ICTB (Intratheater Commercial Transportation Branch, European Command). Deliveries to the DESC during 2007 include the following: From February -December of 2007, the DESC received 430 thousand gallons of AVGAS from Petrol Ofisi, 25 million gallons of diesel fuel from Golteks, and 3 million gallons of motor gasoline from Tefirom. From July-December 2007, the DESC received 190 million gallons of Jet A-1, 50 million gallons of diesel, and 8 million gallons of motor gasoline from Kuwait Petroleum Corp. In that same time period, the DESC also received 80 million gallons of JP-8 jet fuel, 4.5 million gallons of diesel fuel, 670 thousand gallons of motor gasoline. As previously mentioned, the price the DESC pays for fuel destined for Iraq does not directly impact how much military units and commands in Iraq are paying because DESC generally charges a set price to all of its customers worldwide. The price of fuel charged to U.S. military units by DESC was raised on July 1, 2008, to reflect the increased cost of crude oil. Table 5 illustrates the change: DESC reports that 81.8% of the fuel used in Iraq during FY2007 was jet fuel, 15.8% was diesel, and 2.6% was gasoline. The cost of gasoline in Iraq is heavily subsidized by the Iraqi government. As such, the price most Iraqis pay for fuel is not indicative of the true cost of fuel. As part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, fuel subsidies have been and may continue to be reduced (see Table 6 for current subsidized prices). According to one report, the Iraqi government reduced its subsidies from $6 billion in 2005 to approximately $2.5 billion in 2007. It is estimated that the official price for a gallon of regular gasoline in Iraq now stands at approximately $1.44. However, as this price is subsidized by the government, the black market price of gasoline can be almost three times the official price, reportedly hovering around $4.00 a gallon. The black market price of gasoline may be a closer reflection of the true cost of gasoline in Iraq than the subsidized government price. Comparing the cost of fuels delivered to the CENTCOM area of responsibility and the cost paid by Iraq's civilian population is difficult. A number of the fuels used by the U.S. military are generally not used by Iraqi civilians. Where comparable fuels such as gasoline and diesel are used, it is estimated that the military units pay higher prices than Iraqi civilians paying the official price for a number of reasons, including (1) the Iraqi government subsidizes the cost of gasoline and diesel in Iraq, (2) the military likely has higher transportation costs associated with bringing fuel into Iraq, and (3) the price charged by the DESC is the \"level price\" that it charges to all its military customers around the world, irrespective of the actual cost of fuel supplied to Iraq.", "completion": "response:\nSince the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the average price of fuels purchased for military operations in Iraq has steadily increased. The disparity between the higher price of fuel supplied to the United States Central Command compared to Iraq's civilian population has been a point of contention. Several factors contribute to the disparity, including the different types of fuel used by the military compared to Iraqi civilians, the Iraqi government's price subsidies, and the level pricing that the DOD's Defense Logistics Agency charges for military customers around the world. The Iraqi government has been pressured to reduce its fuel subsidy and black market fuel prices remain higher than the official subsidized price."}

There are no exact figures for the total number of D-Day participants nor exact casualty figures. Some historians estimate that more than 70,000 Americans and more than 80,000 combined British, Canadian, Free French, and Polish troops participated, including 23,000 men arriving by parachute and glider. According to estimates from the National D-Day Memorial Museum, the Allied forces suffered 9,758 casualties, of which 6,603 were Americans. The Jubilee of Liberty Medal was first awarded in June 1994 to American servicemen for their participation in the Battle of Normandy. The medals were minted at the request of the Regional Council of Normandy to be presented to veterans attending the 50 th anniversary of the D-Day landing on June 6, 1994. Eligible veterans included all who served in Normandy from June 6 to August 31, 1944, comprising land forces, off-shore supporting personnel, and airmen flying cover overhead. The only stipulation was that the medal be presented during an official ceremony, and the veteran be present to accept. On the front of the medal is inscribed, \"Overlord 6 Juin 1944\" on the upper part of the medal, with the flags of the allied nations and the names of the landing beaches completing the face of the medal. On the reverse side is the Torch of Freedom surrounded by the device of William the Conqueror 'Diex Aie' (\"God is with us\" in Norman French). Unfortunately, these medals are no longer being awarded by the French government. All medals to commemorate the 50 th anniversary ceremony on June 6, 1994, have been distributed by the French government. Additional medals for those veterans who were unable to attend the anniversary ceremony were later distributed through the Association Debarquement et Bataille de Normandie 1944 in France, which is now defunct. Some Members of Congress have awarded the Jubilee of Liberty Medals to U.S. veterans who were unable to attend the ceremony in France on June 6, 1994. These medals were obtained either from the Association Debarquement et Bataille de Normandie 1944 or from a commercial source. Commercially-minted Jubilee of Liberty Medals are being manufactured by Sims Enterprises, a private company in Kansas, that is selling these medals at a cost of $17 for each individual medal (includes shipping and handling ) or $13 each for orders of 10 or more medals (plus an additional charge for shipping).

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOnly federal employees hired before 1984 participate in the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). The CSRS is closed to new entrants and will expire with the death of the last CSRS annuitant sometime around the year 2075. Civilian federal employees who were hired in 1984 or later participate in the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), as do employees who voluntarily switched from CSRS to FERS during \"open seasons\" that were held in 1987 and 1998. The FERS program began operating on January 1, 1987. Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for CSRS annuities are based on the average monthly percentage change in the CPI-W in the third quarter (July to September) of the current calendar year compared with the third quarter of the base year, which is the year in which the last COLA was applied. The base year for determining the COLA effective in December 2018 (paid out in 2019) is 2017. Adjustments are effective on the first day of the month preceding the month in which they are first paid. COLAs for benefits paid under FERS also are based on the percentage change in the CPI-W from third quarter to third quarter, but payment of COLAs under FERS is limited according to the eligibility category of the beneficiary and th e rate of inflation. COLAs are not paid to nondisabled FERS retirees as long as they are under the age of 62. COLAs are paid to survivors and disabled FERS retirees of any age after the first year of disability. All COLAs paid under FERS are limited if the rate of inflation exceeds 2.0%, according to the following formula: From the third quarter of 2017 (the current base year) to the third quarter of 2018, the CPI-W increased by 2.8%. Therefore, paid out beginning January 2019, the CSRS COLA is 2.8% and the FERS COLA is 2.0%. P.L. 87-793 (enacted in 1962) was the first law that provided for automatic adjustments in civil service retirement and disability benefits whenever the CPI in the current year exceeded the CPI in the base year (the year in which the last adjustment occurred) by 3.0% or more. In 1965, this was changed to require an adjustment in benefits whenever the CPI for a given month was at least 3.0% higher than in the month when the last adjustment was made, and remained at that level or higher for three consecutive months. P.L. 91-93 (enacted in 1969) added one percentage point to COLAs in addition to the percentage change in the CPI to offset the erosion of benefits that had occurred as a result of the time lag in the adjustment formula. (P.L. 91-179 did the same for COLAs paid to military retirees.) P.L. 94-440 (enacted in October 1976) repealed the one percentage point addition to COLAs. In addition, this law provided for automatic semiannual adjustments in benefits based on the change in the CPI from June to December (effective the following March 1) and December to June (effective the following September 1). P.L. 97-35 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981) replaced semiannual COLAs with annual COLAs based on the December-to-December change in the CPI, payable in March of the following year. P.L. 97-253 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982) delayed the implementation of COLAs by one month in FY1983, FY1984, and FY1985. The FY1983 COLA was effective April 1 rather than March 1. The FY1984 COLA was scheduled for May 1 and the FY1985 COLA was scheduled for June 1. This law also mandated that nondisabled retirees under the age of 62 would receive 50% of the projected CPI plus the full difference in the actual CPI over these projections. The law specified that the projected CPI was 6.6% for 1983, 7.2% for 1984, and 6.6% for 1985. This provision was repealed by the supplemental appropriations law that was passed in August 1984. COLAs for January 1985 and thereafter were to be the full amount for all retirees. P.L. 97-253 limited COLAs in certain cases. Under the restriction, an annuity could not be increased by a COLA to an amount that exceeded the greater of the maximum pay for a GS-15 federal employee or the final pay of the employee (or high-3 average pay, if greater), increased by the average annual percentage change (compounded) in rates of pay of the General Schedule for the period beginning on the retiree's annuity starting date and ending on the effective date of the adjustment. P.L. 98-270 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1983, enacted April 1984) delayed the COLA scheduled for May 1984 until December (payable in January 1985). Thereafter, all COLAs were to be effective in December and payable in January and were to be based on the change in the average monthly CPI-W from third-quarter to third-quarter. This formula and schedule are the same as those used to calculate COLAs in the Social Security program, as required by P.L. 98-21 (Social Security Amendments of 1983). P.L. 98-369 (Deficit Reduction Act of 1984) specified that civilian and military retirement COLAs are to be paid in checks issued on the first business day of the month following the month in which they are effective. (COLAs that are effective in December are to be paid in checks issued in January.) P.L. 99-177 (Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1981 [Gramm-Rudman-Hollings]). This law suspended all civil service retirement COLAs for FY1986 and for all subsequent years in which the specified deficit reduction targets for the year would not otherwise be met. P.L. 99-509 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986). This law reinstated COLAs for programs in which they were subject to suspension under P.L. 99-177 for FY1987-FY1991. P.L. 100-119 (Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987). This law permanently exempted the programs subject to suspension of COLAs under P.L. 99-177 from the suspensions required by that law. P.L. 103-66 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993). This law postponed the effective date of COLAs from December to March for FY1994-FY1996. The CPI measurement period was not changed.", "completion": "response:\nCost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) are based on the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). COLAs for both CSRS and FERS are determined by the average monthly CPI-W during the third quarter (July to September) of the current calendar year and the third quarter of the base year, which is the last previous year in which a COLA was applied. The \"effective date\" for COLAs is December, but they first appear in the benefits issued during the following January. All CSRS retirees and survivors receive COLAs. Under FERS, however, nondisabled retirees under the age of 62 do not receive COLAs. Survivors and disabled retirees are eligible for COLAs under FERS regardless of age. CSRS pays a COLA that is equal to the percentage change in the CPI-W during the measurement period, but COLAs under FERS are limited if the rate of inflation is greater than 2.0%. If the rate of inflation during the measurement period is between 2.0% and 3.0%, the COLA under FERS is 2.0%. If inflation is greater than 3.0%, then the COLA for FERS benefits is equal to the CPI-W minus one percentage point. Congress passed the first law requiring automatic COLAs for federal civil service retirement benefits in 1962, and it has adjusted either the formula by which they are calculated or the date on which they take effect more than a dozen times since then. If consumer prices as measured by the CPI-W do not increase from the third quarter of the base year to the third quarter of the current calendar year, there is no COLA for annuities paid under CSRS or FERS. For example, from the third quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2015, the CPI-W fell by 0.4%. Therefore, no COLA was paid under either CSRS or FERS beginning January 2016. From the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018, the CPI-W increased by 2.8%. Therefore, beginning in January 2019, the CSRS COLA is 2.8% and the FERS COLA is 2.0%."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nAs of February 11, 2009, a total of 240 persons have served for 30 years or more in the United States Congress as Representative or Senator. That number is only 2% of the 11,893 men and women who have represented their states and congressional districts since the First Congress convened on March 4, 1789. Of the 240 Members serving 30 years or more, 139 served only in the House of Representatives; 29 served only in the Senate; and 72 served in both chambers. Four of the 240 Members are women, three of whom have served in the House and Senate. Over time, the number of Members serving 30 years or more has grown. Only two Members with over 30 years of service began serving in Congress in the 18 th century: Nathaniel Macon began his service in 1791; Samuel Smith, in 1793. Seven served entirely during the 19 th century. By 1967 (90 th Congress), a total of 100 Members had served 30 years or more. As of February 11, 2009, (111 th Congress) that number had risen to 240. Among Members of the 111 th Congress, 16 incumbent Senators and 18 incumbent Representatives have served 30 years or longer. Table 1 lists Members who have served 30 years or longer in descending order of the length of their congressional service, as measured in days. For each Member, the table presents the Member's party and state represented; dates of the Member's first and last day of service, by chamber; days of service in each chamber; and total days of congressional service. Total service is also presented in years and fractions of years. Calculations of days of service varied according to the pattern of a Member's service. For example— Clarence A. Cannon of Missouri served in one continuous period from 3/4/1923 through 5/12/1964. The elapsed time from one date to the other was 15,045, but because Representative Cannon served for each of the elapsed days and on the first day, we add one day to the elapsed time for a total of 15,046 days. Justin Morrill served in both the House and the Senate, continuously from 3/4/1855 to 3/3/1867 in the House (4,383 days) and from 3/4/1867 to 12/28/1898 in the Senate (11,623 days). Morrill's total congressional service was the sum of those two periods, 16,006 days. Henry Jackson of Washington also served continuously in both the House and the Senate, but because of a statutory change there is an overlap of one day in his official dates of service. Jackson served in the House from 1/3/1941 through 1/3/1953, but his first day in the Senate was also on 1/3/1953. If we simply added his House service (4,384 days) and his Senate service (11,199 days), we would double-count 1/3/1953; so we add the days of service in each chamber (15,583 days) and subtract one day from that sum for Jackson's total days of congressional service (15,582 days). Alternately, we could simply count the days from when his House service started through the date of the day when his Senate service ended. Samuel Smith served in the House, then in the Senate, then again in the House, and then once again in the Senate. His first period of service (in the House) did not overlap with the second (in the Senate). There was a break between his first period of Senate service and his second period of House service, but there is an overlapping day (12/17/1822) when he moved finally from the House again to the Senate. Accordingly, we add the days of each period of service and subtract one day from the sum for a total of 14,276 days of congressional service. Table 1 draws the dates of congressional service from the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-Present ; the \"Table of United States Senators\" in U.S. Congress, Senate, Senate Manual , S. Doc. 104-1; and various editions of the Congressional Directory (Washington: GPO).

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nBefore 1961, no prior authorization was required for defense appropriations, except for construction funds. In 1959, the Armed Services Committees attached a rider to the construction authorization ( P.L. 86-149 ) to req uire prior authorization of appropriations to procure planes, missiles, and ships, beginning in 1961. The committees hoped thereby to recapture a share of the control over defense programs exercised by the Appropriations Committees alone. Congress oversees the defense budget primarily through two yearly bills: the defense authorization and defense appropriations bills. Table 2 and Table 4 present the Department of Defense (DOD) authorization and appropriations bills from 1970 to 2018. The authorization bill establishes and organizes the agencies responsible for national defense, sets policies for the department, and authorizes the appropriations of funds in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §114. The appropriations bill provides budget authority for military departments and defense agencies to draw funds from the Treasury. Ideally, the authorization-appropriations process would proceed in an orderly sequence with each step of the process generating a part of the information trail. All of these steps would be documented in the Congressional Record as well as in many other official documents of Congress, in private publications, such as Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report and United States Code Congressional and Administrative News (USCCAN), and on Congress.gov. Data in Table 1 and Table 3 are mostly from the Congressional Quarterly Almanac . These tables reflect an earlier authorization-appropriations process from 1961 to 1969. In the simplest case, the process begins with the President submitting his budget proposal (initially formulated by DOD and formally submitted by the President through the Office of Management and Budget) to the defense authorizing and appropriations committees. Then, for example, for the defense authorization bill, hearings are held by the appropriate House committees and subcommittees. The bill is marked up and an authorization bill is reported out, usually with a written, numbered report. This bill is debated in the House, amended or not as the case may be, and passed by the House with the vote noted in the Congressional Record . This bill would then be sent to the Senate, debated, and passed. However, the Senate can amend the House bill or report out its own bill, debate, amend, and pass it. If the House and Senate versions differ, the stage is set for reconciling differences. This may be accomplished by a conference committee appointed by the leadership of each chamber. This committee then negotiates a compromise bill that is reported to both houses. Votes on the conference agreement are then taken in both chambers. If passed, it is sent to the President for his consideration and signature. Ideally, after the authorization bill is passed, the appropriations bill goes through this same process. Although conceptually a sequential process, authorization and appropriations bills can be considered at the same time or even passed in reverse order. Legislative text―and the associated bill number―come together for consideration on the floor in a variety of ways. For instance, the Senate can report out a bill, and then substitute the text of the Senate bill for the text of the bill passed by the House while retaining the House bill number. The House can also use this procedure. A Senate or House bill can also have part of the other chamber's bill inserted into it, or can be so heavily amended that it is unclear whether the underlying text originated in the Senate or House bill. Other events can occur to render the tracking of a bill and its contents difficult. Bills are sometimes reported out without an accompanying committee report to provide context for the legislative language. Voice votes or unanimous consent agreements may be granted instead of recorded votes, rendering it impossible to determine which Member voted for or against the bill or amendments offered during floor consideration. In addition, there may be times when a fiscal year ends without the enactment of some appropriations bills. Under those circumstances, Congress usually passes a continuing resolution (CR), which grants a temporary extension of budget authority for a specified period of time and purpose. CRs also typically specify that the funds provided may be used only for activities funded in the previous fiscal year. For more information on the components of a CR and the defense budget, see CRS Report R42647, Continuing Resolutions: Overview of Components and Recent Practices , by James V. Saturno and Jessica Tollestrup. There are several types of votes: voice votes, teller votes, division votes, and unanimous consent votes, but only when there is a recorded vote will there be a vote number and vote tally in the Congressional Record . The section below is based on \"Methods of Voting in the House and Senate: Putting Members' Positions on the Record,\" from the Congressional Quarterly's Guide to Congress , 6th ed. (2008), pp. 582-583. Division vote—those in favor or opposed stand, and the chair takes a head count: only vote totals are announced and there is no record of how individual Members voted. Recorded vote—Members vote electronically, each recorded vote is given a sequential number, and vote totals plus how each Member voted are recorded in the Congressional Record . Teller vote—an older method in which Members were counted as they passed between chair-appointed tellers for the \"ayes\" and \"noes\"; only vote totals are announced and there is no record of how individual Members voted. Unanimous consent vote—usually reserved for noncontroversial legislation. Voice vote—the presiding officer calls for the \"ayes\" and then the \"noes,\" Members shout in chorus on one side or the other, and the chair decides the result. For more information on the process, see CRS In Focus IF10515, Defense Primer: The NDAA Process , by Valerie Heitshusen and Brendan W.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nA court handling an interstate child custody dispute must consider whether it has jurisdiction to decide the custody case. Three laws provide the answer as to whether a particular court has jurisdiction: the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act [PKPA], the Uniform Child Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act [UCJEA] and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act [UCCJA], which has been enacted in some form in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. The PKPA gives priority to the child's home state (the state where the child lived with at least one parent for six months before the custody petition was filed). If one parent moves with the child to live in a new state, the original state continues to be the home state for an additional six months after the move. The child need not be physically present in the original state for the child custody proceeding to be initiated there by the parent who remained behind. Yes. In all states, custody orders can be modified by a court to further the best interests of the child. Usually, the parent requesting the modification must convince a judge that a substantial change in circumstances affecting the child's welfare has occurred since the original custody order was entered. Under the PKPA, the court that issued the initial custody decree has \"continuing jurisdiction\" over custody matters, provided that the first state meets three preconditions: (1) it entered its initial custody order in accordance with the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act; (2) the child or one parent continues to live in the state; and (3) the state's own law allows continuing jurisdiction. If these conditions are met, a parent living in another state who wants to modify the initial custody arrangement must file the modification petition in the first state. The UCCJA provides that dismissal is mandatory where the noncustodial parent violates an existing custody order by refusing to return the child to the custodial parent at the end of the child's period of visitation and then asks the out-of-state court to modify custody. Neither the PKPA, UCJEA nor the UCCJA totally precludes the second state from ever modifying the initial custody order. The PKPA permits the second state to modify the initial custody provision if: (1) the second state has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination and (2) the first state no longer has jurisdiction or has declined to exercise jurisdiction. The remedies available under the UCJEA and UCCJA are unavailing if the left-behind parent is unable to find the abducting parent and the child. For this reason, the PKPA makes the federal Parent Locator Service available to assist local police in locating the abductor. The PKPA also provides that any state that treats parental kidnapping as a felony may enlist the F.B.I.'s assistance under the federal Fugitive Felon Act in locating the abducting parent, provided he or she has left the state. In many states, parental kidnapping (also known as interference with parental custody) is a felony, depending upon the circumstances. In others, it is a felony if the child is taken from the state. However, in most states, there can be no kidnapping unless there is an existing custody order that the parent has intentionally violated. Because many parental kidnappings take place before a final custody decree is entered, a few states have extended criminal sanctions to kidnappings that occur before the final custody decree. Several states also permit the court to assess expenses incurred in returning the child against any person convicted of violating the state's criminal custodial interference law. Parents, although they are subject to the PKPA, remain exempt from criminal sanctions under the general federal kidnapping statute. International parental kidnapping is a federal crime, punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for up to three years. Once the child has been located, a possible solution to the abduction may be provided by the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The Convention is in force in approximately 40 countries, including the United States, Mexico, Canada, and most of Europe. The countries that have signed the Hague Convention have agreed that a child who is habitually a resident in one country and who is removed to or retained in another country in breach of the left-behind parent's custody rights must be promptly returned to the country of the child's habitual residence. However, the Convention is inapplicable if the child has been abducted to a country that has not signed the Convention or the child is sixteen or older. Although there need not be a custody decree to invoke the Convention, the left-behind parent must be able to prove that he or she is exercising a \"right of custody\" at the time of abduction and that he or she had not given permission for the child to be removed or to be retained in the foreign country beyond a specified, agreed-upon time. In the absence of a formal custody order, custodial rights are determined by state law. It is important to remember that a Hague Convention proceeding is not a custody case. At a hearing under the Hague Convention, the judge's job is to determine only where the custody hearing should take place, not who is entitled to custody of the child. The goal of the Hague Convention is the child's swift return to his or her original country where the custody dispute can then be resolved, if necessary, in that country's courts. Parents are obliged to pay child support whether or not they were ever married. Parents also have an obligation to support all of their children, not just the children who reside with them. Thus, although the noncustodial parent is married to someone else or supporting other children, he or she has a continuing obligation to support the children of a previous marriage or relationship. Yes. As of January 1, 1994, the Family Support Act of 1988 requires that all new child support orders provide for automatically withholding child support payments from the obligated parent's paycheck, regardless of whether or not support payments are late. Federal law permits an exception to immediate withholding if the court finds good cause or if the parents both agree to another arrangement. However, a parent who falls at least one month behind in support payments is subject to withholding even in these cases. Withholding may be used to collect current support payments as well as arrearages. States have the option, under federal law, to apply withholding to income other than wages and to order withholding from bonuses, commissions, retirement benefits, rental or interest income, or unemployment compensation benefits. Yes. States permit a child support order to be modified upward or downward based on proof of a substantial change in the parents' financial circumstances or the child's needs. In addition, federal law requires that child support orders be reviewed every three years unless neither parent requests a review or, in temporary assistance for needy families [TANF] cases, if the review would not be in the child's best interest. However, child support orders may only be modified prospectively. The 1986 Bradley amendment to the federal child support laws effectively bars retroactive modification that would wipe out past-due support obligations. Yes. A parent who willfully refuses to comply with a lawful order of child support, though able to do so, may be held in contempt of court and jailed or fined for a fixed period of time as punishment or for an indefinite period until the child support is paid. As of October 1992, failure to pay child support in the interstate context has become a federal crime. An out-of-state parent who has willfully failed to pay court-ordered child support for at least one year or who is at least $5,000 in arrears may be criminally prosecuted by the local United States attorney. For a first offense, the penalties include a fine and/or a prison sentence of up to six months in prison; for a second offense, the punishment is a fine and/or up to two years in jail. A custodial parent who needs to obtain or enforce a child support order but who cannot find the noncustodial parent may enlist the assistance of a child support enforcement agency run by the state or local government, known as a IV-D agency. This assistance is available to all custodial parents, regardless of whether or not they receive public assistance.", "completion": "response:\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, Congress has little direct authority to legislate in the field of domestic relations.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nNo. Congress wrote restrictions that would have prevented the closure of military installations without prior congressional action into several National Defense Authorization Acts during the 1960s and 1970s, but each of these bills was vetoed. Nevertheless, Congress has been able to place in statute provisions that delay actions to reduce operations at or close installations that employ civilians above certain numbers. What is commonly referred to as a \"BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) round,\" a comprehensive reduction of Department of Defense (DOD) real property, has been carried out under the provisions of temporary statutes. The authorization for the most recent BRAC round expired on April 16, 2006. As outlined below, the President and his subordinates have considerable existing authority to close military installations. Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution appoints the President as the commander in chief of the Army, the Navy, and the state Militias (National Guards) when they are called into federal service. This gives the President the authority to deploy those forces, which in common practice has included creating and closing the installations needed to house and train them. Title 10 of the United States Code encompasses laws pertaining to the federal armed forces. Section 113 of Title 10 (10 U.S.C. §113) creates a Secretary of Defense, who is the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to DOD and who has authority, direction, and control over the department. The Secretary is second to the President in commanding operational military forces. Other sections within Title 10 create the secretaries of the military departments (Army, Navy, and Air Force). These offices are under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense, and their statutory powers include the administration of federal real property (facilities and land) needed to carry out the functions of their departments. The authority to create, realign, or close installations under their administration has commonly been held to be one of those powers. Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution gives the Congress the authority to raise revenues and pay the debts of the United States, to provide for the common Defense, and to raise armies, maintain a Navy, and regulate the Militias when called to federal service. Therefore, Congress funds the operations of DOD through its annual defense and military construction appropriations acts and sets DOD organization and policy through the annual National Defense Authorization Act. Through this legislation, Congress authorizes the acquisition and transfer of title of military real property; funds the construction, maintenance, and operation of military installations; empowers DOD to waive statutory requirements in the disposal of property, and otherwise enables DOD to shape and maintain its infrastructure inventory. Nevertheless, primarily because the President and his subordinates have been responsible for the deployment of military forces, Congress has been hesitant to direct the creation or disestablishment of specific military installations. Yes. Congress has passed, and the President has enacted, restrictions on presidential powers to close military installations using the annual appropriation and defense authorization bills. Yes, some are. Principal among them are 10 U.S.C. §2687 (Base Closures and Realignments), enacted in 1977, and 10 U.S.C. 993 (Notification of Permanent Reduction of Sizable Numbers of Members of the Armed Forces), enacted in 2011. These sections impose a \"notify, evaluate, and wait\" process on the Secretary of Defense and the secretaries of the military departments before they may take actions to close or realign any military installation that meets certain criteria. Under 10 U.S.C. §2687 , for military installations at which at least 300 civilian personnel are authorized to be employed, the Secretary of Defense or a secretary of a military department may take no action to carry out a closure until he submits to the Committees on Armed Services of the House and Senate 1. notification of the closure as part of the department's annual request for appropriations; 2. an evaluation of the fiscal, local economic, budgetary, environmental, strategic, and operational consequences of the closure; 3. the criteria used to consider and recommend the military installation for closure; and 4. a period of 30 legislative days or 60 calendar days, whichever is longer, expires following the day on which the notice and evaluation is submitted to the committees. The statute defines a realignment as any action that both reduces and relocates functions and civilian personnel positions. Exempted from the definition of a realignment is a reduction in force resulting from workload adjustments, reduced personnel or funding levels, skill imbalances, or other similar causes. For realignments at installations of at least 300 authorized civilian positions, it imposes the same restrictions on the secretaries as a closure if the realignment involves a reduction by more than 1,000, or by more than 50%, in the number of civilian personnel authorized to be employed there. The section also bans the preparation of any facility at another military installation intended to accept employees relocated by the closure or realignment until the four conditions listed above have been fulfilled. While Section 2687 is predicated on the predicted reduction of civilian employees at an installation, 10 U.S.C. §993 lays out a similar, though slightly different, process where a reduction in uniformed military personnel is involved. Section 993 prevents the secretaries concerned from taking any irrevocable action to implement a reduction of more than 1,000 members of the armed forces at an installation until they 1. notify the Committees on Armed Services of the reduction (there is no restriction on when such notification may be given); 2. justify the reduction and evaluate its local strategic and operational impact; 3. wait for a period of 21 days after the notification is submitted (14 days if submitted in electronic format). Both statutes state that they do not apply in cases where the actions are being taken for reasons of national security or a military emergency No. U.S. Joint Forces Command, a major combatant command, was headquartered in several military installations in the Hampton Roads, Virginia, area. During August of 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that the command would be disestablished and its headquarters staff would be disbanded, an event that occurred on August 31, 2011. Although the civilian employment within the headquarters exceeded the number needed to invoke Section 2687, it was not concentrated on a single installation. Rather, the disbandment represented either a reduction in force or a realignment at each of the several installations it affected. At none of the installations did the reduction in numbers reach a realignment threshold. Section 993, pertaining to the number of uniformed personnel, was not enacted until after JFCOM was disestablished. Therefore, there was no statutory requirement for congressional notification and justification. No. As outlined earlier, BRAC has been a process established under specific authorization from Congress that has been time-limited. There have been five distinct BRAC rounds, of which the last four have been carried out under the provisions of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended. The authority under that act expired on April 16, 2006. Therefore, there can be no future BRAC round until and unless Congress passes and the President signs legislation that specifically authorizes one. Because the relevant statutory authority has expired any such future round need not follow processes used in prior rounds. The issues involved with the closing of any military installation can cover a range not necessarily restricted to those regarding real property.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe United States Congress is served by a group of young adults known as pages. Pages have been employed since the early Congresses, and some Members of Congress have served as pages. Today, congressional pages include students who are juniors in high school and who may come from all areas of the United States and its territories. The page system is formally provided for in law, although the rationale for the page service or for using high school students is not. Since the earliest accounts of pages, it has been widely noted in debates and writings within Congress that pages provide needed messenger services: From the origin of the present government, in 1789, to the present time, they [messengers] have been under the orders and resolutions of the House, and experience has attested to the necessity of their services. The use of boys or pages, was introduced at a later period; but from the first session of Congress held at the city of Washington [1800], they have continued to be employed by the House, with the approbation of the House. Being a page provides a unique educational opportunity, affording young adults an opportunity to learn about Congress, the legislative process, and to develop workplace and leadership skills. Over the years, there has been concern about having young pages serve Congress. In the 1800s and early 1900s, some House pages were as young as 10 and Senate pages as young as 13. Later, they were as old as 18. At various times, congressional actions related to employing pages have addressed the lack of supervised housing as well as pages' ages, tenure, selection, education, and management. Far-reaching reforms in the page system were implemented in 1982 and 1983, following press reports of insufficient supervision, alleged sexual misconduct, and involvement in the trafficking of drugs on Capitol Hill. Most reports of misbehavior were later found to be unsubstantiated. As a consequence of the allegations, however, both the House and Senate for the first time provided supervised housing for their pages; established separate page schools and took over the education of the pages, which had been provided under contract by the District of Columbia school system; and developed more educational and recreational opportunities for their pages. In the 110 th Congress (2007-2008), at the request of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Leader John Boehner, the House inspector general (IG) conducted an inquiry into the supervision and operation of the House Page Residence Hall, and subsequently issued a confidential report recommending changes. In 2008, an independent study, conducted by consultants to the House, was conducted. In response to the findings of those efforts, the House implemented new policies to enhance the safety and supervision of the pages and oversight of the page program. These changes followed investigations of allegations related to the page program participants, including the exchange of inappropriate communications between a Member of the House and former pages, and of misbehavior by a few pages in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses. A follow up review of the page program was carried out in the summer of 2010 by the same independent consultants. According to House leaders, concerns raised in 2008, including costs and the need for the program, remained. In August 2011, Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced the termination of the House page program effective August 31. In a Dear Colleague Letter, the leaders cited both changes in technology obviating the need for most page services, and the program's costs as reasons to discontinue the program. In the 112 th Congress, (2011-2012), H.Res. 397 , entitled Reestablishing the House of Representatives Page Program, was introduced by Representative Dan Boren. The resolution would have created an advisory panel to make recommendations for the operation of a reestablished page program. The House page program would have been reestablished in the first school semester after the advisory panel submitted its recommendations to the Committee on House Administration. Membership of the nine-person advisory body would have been composed of three Members of the House from the majority party of the House, three Members of the House from the minority party, and three individuals who were not Members and who had served as House pages. The measure was referred to the Committee on House Administration, and no further action was taken. Pages serve principally as messengers. They carry documents between the House and Senate, Members' offices, committees, and the Library of Congress. They prepare the Senate chamber for each day's business by distributing the Congressional Record and other documents related to the day's agenda, assist in the cloakrooms and chambers; and when Congress is in session, they sit near the dais where they may be summoned by Members for assistance. In the House, pages also previously raised and lowered the flag on the roof of the Capitol. There are 30 Senate page positions, 16 for the majority party and 14 for the minority party. The office of the Sergeant at Arms supervises the Senate page program. The Senate page program consists of four quarters, two academic year sessions and two shorter summer sessions. It is administered by the Senate Sergeant at Arms, the Senate page program director, and the principal of the Senate page school. Senate pages are paid a stipend, and deductions are taken for taxes and residence hall fee, which includes a meal plan. Pages must pay their transportation costs to Washington, DC, but their uniforms are supplied. The uniforms consist of navy blue suits, white shirts, red and blue striped tie, dark socks, and black shoes. The Senate provides its pages education and supervised housing in the Daniel Webster Page Residence near the Hart Senate Office Building. The Senate Page School is located in the lower level of Webster Hall. Pages who serve during the academic year are educated in this school, which is also accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The junior-year curriculum is geared toward college preparation and emphasis is given to the unique learning opportunities available in Washington, DC. Early morning classes are held prior to the convening of the Senate. The House page program was administered by the Office of the Clerk, under the supervision of the House Page Board. The board, established in statute, is composed of two Members from each party, including the chair, as well as the Clerk and the Sergeant at Arms of the House, a former House page, and the parent of a House page. Participants in the House page program typically served for one academic semester during the school year, or during a summer session. House pages received a stipend for their services, and deductions were taken from their salaries for federal and state taxes, Social Security, and a residence hall fee, which included a meal plan. The pages were required to live in the supervised House Page Dormitory near the Capitol. They were responsible for the cost of their uniforms—navy jackets, dark grey slacks or skirts, long sleeve white shirt, red and blue striped tie, and black shoes—and transportation to and from Washington, DC. During the school year, pages were educated in the House Page School located in the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress. The page school, which is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, offered a junior-year high-school curriculum, college preparatory courses, and extracurricular and weekend activities. Classes were usually held five days a week, commencing at 6:45 a.m., prior to the convening of the House. ", "completion": "response:\nFor more than 180 years, messengers known as pages have served the United States Congress. Pages must be high school juniors and at least 16 years of age. Several incumbent and former Members of Congress as well as other prominent Americans have served as congressional pages. Senator Daniel Webster appointed the first Senate page in 1829. The first House pages began their service in 1842. Women were first appointed as pages in 1971. In August 2011, House leaders announced the termination of that chamber's page program. Senate pages are appointed and sponsored by Senators for one academic semester of the school year, or for a summer session. The right to appoint pages rotates among Senators pursuant to criteria set by the Senate's leadership. Academic standing is one of the most important criteria used in the final selection of pages. Selection criteria for House pages was similar when the page program operated in that chamber. Prospective Senate pages are advised to contact their Senators to request consideration for a page appointment."}

Daily updates of total U.S. military and civilian casualties in OIF, OEF, OND, OIR, and OFS can be found at the Department of Defense's (DOD's) website, at http://www.defense.gov/news/casualty.pdf . Table 1 gives the overall casualties in OIF, OND, and OEF. The U.S. Army Office of the Surgeon General (OSG), using the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS), provided data on the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases. According to Dr. Michael Carino of the OSG, a case of PTSD is defined as an individual with two or more outpatient visits or one or more hospitalizations during which PTSD was diagnosed. The threshold of two or more outpatient visits is used in the DMSS to increase the likelihood that the individual has, or had, clinically diagnosable PTSD. A single visit on record commonly reflects a servicemember who was evaluated for possible PTSD, but did not actually meet the criteria for clinical diagnosis. In this data set, an incident of PTSD among deployed servicemembers is defined as occurring when a deployed servicemember was diagnosed with PTSD at least 30 days after being deployed. Many statistics on traumatic brain injury (TBI) are available to the public, at the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, at http://dvbic.dcoe.mil/dod-worldwide-numbers-tbi . Unlike PTSD numbers, which are segmented by those deployed and those not previously deployed, TBI numbers represent medical diagnoses of TBI that occurred anywhere U.S. forces are located, including the continental United States. Table 4 shows the number of individuals with battle-injury major limb amputations for OEF, OFS, OIF, OND, and OIR. A major limb amputation includes the loss of one or more limbs, the loss of one or more partial limbs, or the loss of one or more full or partial hand or foot. The total number of individuals with major limb amputations as of June 1, 2015, is 1,645.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) was created by §20301 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, and it is currently codified in §241(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The program is administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), which is part of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of Justice Programs (OJP). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aids BJA in administering the program. SCAAP is designed to reimburse states and localities for correctional officers' salary costs incurred for incarcerating \"undocumented criminal aliens.\" The INA defines the term \"undocumented criminal alien\" in the context of SCAAP to mean an alien who (3)(A) has been convicted of a felony or two or more misdemeanors; and (I) entered the United States without inspection or at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General; (ii) was the subject of exclusion or deportation proceedings at the time he or she was taken into custody by the State or a political subdivision of the State; or (iii) was admitted as a nonimmigrant and at the time he or she was taken into custody by the State or a political subdivision of the State has failed to maintain the nonimmigrant status in which the alien was admitted or to which it was changed under Section 248, or to comply with the conditions of any such status. Any state or locality that incurred costs for incarcerating \"undocumented criminal aliens\" is eligible to apply for SCAAP funding. Currently, this includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and more than 3,000 counties and cities. For states and localities to qualify for SCAAP reimbursement, aliens under their jurisdiction must have at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions under state or local law and be incarcerated for at least four consecutive days. Although the program is intended to compensate states and localities for correctional officers' salary costs, funds provided through SCAAP payments until recently have been unrestricted and could be used for any lawful purpose. In some instances, SCAAP funds were used for projects such as interoperable communications systems, inmate medical care, and construction. In many instances, funds were used for the jurisdiction's criminal justice system or jails. The criteria for the amount of SCAAP funds received have evolved over time. Prior to FY2003, the criteria were based on factors such as average cost per inmate multiplied by the number of eligible inmates and the total number of foreign-born inmates claimed. In many cases, this resulted in reimbursement for ineligible aliens such as naturalized citizens and legal permanent residents (LPRs). The formula is determined administratively by DOJ. In FY2007, the SCAAP reimbursement formula was determined through a multi-step process, as follows. DOJ determined a per diem rate per inmate, using a combination of correctional officers' annual salary costs and the total number of all inmate days. (The average inmate per diem for FY2007 was $30.30); Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in DHS analyzed applicant inmate records submitted by the applicants, and provided BJA with a report reflecting the number of eligible, ineligible, unknown, and invalid inmates; The number of inmate days and a percentage of unknown days were totaled, then multiplied by the applicant's per diem rate; The value of each applicant's correctional officers' salary costs associated with its eligible and credited unknown inmate days was totaled. (This value reflected the maximum allowable reimbursement); and The values were compared with the annual appropriation and a percentage factor was developed, and the percentage factor was applied uniformly to all jurisdictions. The reimbursement factor for FY2007 SCAAP awards was approximately 42%. Funding for SCAAP has been appropriated by Congress annually since 1995. Levels of funding for the program have fluctuated from $130 million in FY1995 to $565 million in FY2002 and have remained relatively consistent between $400 and $410 million for FY2006 through FY2009. The Administration's FY2010 budget did not request funding for this program. From FY2000 to FY2008, SCAAP reimbursements totaled approximately $4 billion. As Table 1 illustrates, California historically has received the largest annual awards, having received more than $1.7 billion since the program's inception. Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas have consistently received larger awards as well, with smaller awards going to states such as West Virginia, Vermont, North Dakota, and the U.S. territories. In 2005, SCAAP was reauthorized through FY2011, and a provision was added that required SCAAP reimbursement funds be used for correctional purposes only. Legislation had been introduced in previous Congresses that would have modified the program to include covering costs for indigent defense, translators, criminal aliens charged with two misdemeanors or a felony, and limited reimbursement to border states and states with large numbers of unauthorized aliens. In the 111 th Congress, legislation has been introduced to reauthorize the program until FY2014 ( H.R. 2282 ), and to allow costs related to criminal aliens charged with specified crimes to be considered for SCAAP reimbursement ( S. 168 ). The Administration's FY2010 budget request did not include funding for SCAAP; however, funding for the program was included in the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2010 ( H.R. 2847 ). H.R. 2847 as passed by the House on June 18, 2009, would appropriate $300 million for SCAAP, and the Senate reported version would appropriate $228 million for the program.", "completion": "response:\nThe State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) is a formula grant program that provides financial assistance to states and localities for correctional officer salary costs incurred for incarcerating \"undocumented criminal aliens.\" Currently, SCAAP funds do not cover all of the costs for incarcerating immigrants or foreign nationals. The program is administered by the Office of Justice Programs' Bureau of Justice Assistance, located in the U.S. Department of Justice, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Between FY1995 and FY2009, a total of more than $5 billion has been distributed to states in SCAAP funding. Recent changes to SCAAP include reauthorization through FY2011 and the requirement that SCAAP reimbursements be used for correctional purposes only. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress includes provisions that would extend the program through FY2014 and authorize appropriations at $1 billion annually for FY2011-FY2014 (H.R. 2282); and would change SCAAP eligibility guidelines to reimburse states not only for criminal aliens convicted of two misdemeanors or a felony, but also for those charged with these crimes as well (S. 168).

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's decisions regarding the nature of the people's right to \"keep and bear arms,\" as guaranteed in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, has focused some interest in the extent to which firearms are protected from the reach of creditors under either federal or state laws. State laws that protect certain property from creditors' claims generally are designed to apply in non-bankruptcy contexts, but may also be used in bankruptcy. Federal law also protects certain property from creditors' claims in bankruptcy. Additionally, a debtor in bankruptcy may be able to avoid liens against exempt property if a lien impairs the exemption and is either a judicial lien or a nonpossessory, nonpurchase-money security interest. Legislation introduced in the 112 th Congress, similar to legislation passed by the House in the 111 th Congress, would have allowed a specific federal exemption for firearms and would include firearms in the definition of household goods whose exemptions could be protected from impairment by liens. A number of states provide their own exemptions for firearms. The provisions of these states are provided in Table 1 . Section 522 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code addresses the extent to which an individual debtor may elect to exempt equity in certain property from becoming part of the bankruptcy estate. Property exempted from the bankruptcy estate is not available to satisfy creditors. Among the exemptions explicitly provided in the Bankruptcy Code—the federal exemptions—are a homestead exemption in the amount of $21,625, a vehicle exemption in the amount of $3,450, and exemptions for jewelry, tools of the trade, and household goods. There is also a \"wildcard\" exemption of $1,150 that can also be applied to any property so long as the federal exemptions are available to the debtor. To the extent allowed under state law, the Bankruptcy Code permits debtors to choose between using the federal exemptions or those available under applicable state law. This is an \"either/or\" choice—debtors are not allowed to choose to use some state exemptions and some federal exemptions. When a petition is filed jointly by husband and wife or when the individual cases of a husband and wife are ordered to be jointly administered, each spouse must choose the same set of exemptions. However, debtors in many states have no choice to make because their state law prohibits the use of the federal exemptions. These federal exemptions are available to debtors only to the extent they are not prohibited by the applicable state. Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and 17 states allow debtors to choose between federal and state exemptions. In 2012, Virginia became the thirteenth state to provide some protection from creditors for debtors' firearms. The conditions for exempting firearms vary among the relevant states. Some states specify the number of firearms that may be exempted without regard to the value of the firearms. Other states limit the exemption to one firearm and further limit the claimed exemption by either the value of the firearm or the aggregate value of the statutorily exempt property in which the firearm is included. Oregon allows an exemption for one pistol as well as one rifle or shotgun, but limits the total exemption value of the two firearms to no more than $1,000. Several states put no limit on the number of firearms that may be exempted so long as the total value of the firearms, when aggregated with the value of certain other property is less than a specific amount. In these states, there is generally a limit to the value of each firearm. One state, Oklahoma, allows an unlimited number of firearms to be exempted so long as the total value of the firearms, alone, is no more than $2,000. In most of the states, the exemption is not controlled by the way in which the firearm is used. Several states, however, exempt only guns that are for personal use. Three of these specify that the firearms are to be \"held primarily for the personal, family, or household use of [the debtor].\" Oregon law specifies that the firearms must be \"for the own use and defense of the citizen.\" Only one state, Louisiana, requires that the exempted firearm be used for business purposes. Both Montana and Nevada exempt \"all arms ... required by law to be kept by any person\" in addition to the one gun, selected by the debtor, that each allows. H.R. 1181 , the Protecting Gun Owners in Bankruptcy Act of 2011, was introduced on March 17, 2011, in the 112 th Congress. The bill paralleled an earlier bill passed by the House in the 111 th Congress, but not voted on by the Senate. The bill would have provided a firearms exemption that could be used in bankruptcy by a debtor who opted to use federal rather than state exemptions and was allowed to do so by the relevant state's law. The bill would have amended Section 522(d) of the Bankruptcy Code to add an exemption for the debtor's aggregate interest─up to a total value of $3,000—\"in a single rifle, shotgun, or pistol or any combination thereof.\" The addition of this exemption would not have reduced the amount allowed for any other type of exemption under Section 522. Additionally, the bill would have amended Section 522(f)(4)(A) to include firearms in the definition of \"household goods.\" As with the exemption for firearms, this provision would have applied to any number or combination of rifles, shotguns, and pistols so long as the aggregate value was no more than $3,000. Inclusion of firearms in the definition of household goods would not have increased the exemption available for firearms, but it would have allowed debtors to avoid liens that are nonpossessory, nonpurchase-money security interests on those firearms, under Section 522(f)(1)(B), as they are currently able to avoid such liens on other household goods. The bill would not have changed the maximum value of household goods whose liens could be avoided in bankruptcy. The last major action on the bill was referral to the Subcommittee on Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law for the House Judiciary Action. Currently, there has been no legislation introduced in the 113 th Congress that would provide a federal exemption under the Bankruptcy Code for firearms.", "completion": "response:\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's decisions regarding the nature of the people's right to \"keep and bear arms,\" as guaranteed in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, has focused some interest on the extent to which firearms are protected from the reach of creditors under either federal or state laws. State laws protecting certain property from creditors' claims may be used both in and outside of the bankruptcy context. Federal law may also protect certain property from creditors' claims in bankruptcy. Although a number of states have provisions explicitly shielding firearms from the claims of creditors, there is currently no such provision in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (title 11). In the 111th Congress, legislation was passed in the House (H.R. 5827) that would have provided an explicit federal exemption in bankruptcy for a debtor's aggregate interest, up to $3,000, \"in a single rifle, shotgun, or pistol, or any combination thereof.\" The bill also included the means for protecting firearms by including them─subject to the same value and type restrictions─in the definition of \"household goods\" for which nonpossessory, nonpurchase-money security interest liens could be avoided in bankruptcy. Similar legislation was introduced in the 112th Congress: the Protecting Gun Owners in Bankruptcy Act of 2011 (H.R. 1181). The Bankruptcy Code generally provides two options for claiming exemptions in bankruptcy─either the exemptions provided in 11 U.S.C. Section 522(d) or the exemptions available under state law. However, debtors may only choose to use the federal exemptions in Section 522(d) if their state specifically authorizes them to do so. Because the proposed federal exemption for firearms would be included in Section 522(d), debtors whose states do not authorize them to use the Section 522(d) exemptions would not benefit from the proposed change in exemptions. They might, however, benefit from the inclusion of firearms in the definition of household goods, because they could then have the option of freeing those firearms from liens that were based on a nonpossessory, nonpurchase-money security interest. There is great variety in the extent of the protection from creditors the states provide for firearms. The majority of states provide no explicit protection. Among the 13 states that provide protection, the conditions for providing that protection vary. Some states limit the exemption by both the number and value of the firearms; some do not limit the number but may limit either the value of each firearm or the aggregate value of all. Other states specify the type of firearms that can be exempted. In most states that allow an exemption for firearms, the exemption is not dependent upon the way in which the firearm is used. Several states, however, exempt only guns that are for personal use, and one state requires that the firearm be used for business purposes."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe offices of the resident commissioner from Puerto Rico and the delegates to the House of Representatives from American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are created by statute, not by the Constitution. Because they represent territories and associated jurisdictions, not states, they do not possess the same parliamentary rights afforded Members. This report examines the parliamentary rights of the delegates and the resident commissioner in legislative committee, in the House, and in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union. Under clause 3 of Rule III, the delegates and the resident commissioner are elected to serve on standing committees in the same manner as Representatives and have the same parliamentary powers and privileges as Representatives there: the right to question witnesses, debate, offer amendments, vote, offer motions, raise points of order, include additional views in committee reports, accrue seniority, and chair committees and subcommittees. The same rule authorizes the Speaker of the House to appoint delegates and the resident commissioner to conference committees as well as to select and joint committees. The delegates and the resident commissioner may not vote in or preside over the House. Although they take an oath to uphold the Constitution, they are not included on the Clerk's roll of Members-elect and may not vote for Speaker. They may not file or sign discharge petitions. They may, however, sponsor and cosponsor legislation, participate in debate—including managing time—and offer any motion that a Representative may make, except the motion to reconsider. A delegate or resident commissioner may raise points of order and questions of personal privilege, call a Member to order, appeal rulings of the chair, file reports for committees, object to the consideration of a bill, and move impeachment proceedings. Under the rules of the 115 th Congress (2017-2018), the delegates and the resident commissioner may not vote in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union. In a change from the rules of the prior Congress, however, they may preside over the Committee of the Whole. Under Rules III and XVIII, as adopted in both the 110 th and 111 th Congresses (2007-2010), when the House was sitting as the Committee of the Whole, the delegates and resident commissioner had the same ability to vote as Representatives, subject to immediate reconsideration in the House when their recorded votes had been \"decisive\" in the committee. These prior House rules also authorized the Speaker to appoint a delegate or the resident commissioner to preside as chairman of the Committee of the Whole. These rules of the 110 th and 111 th Congresses were identical in effect to those in force in the 103 rd Congress (1993-1994), which permitted the delegates and the resident commissioner to vote in, and to preside over, the Committee of the Whole. These provisions were stricken from the rules as adopted in the 104 th Congress (1995-1996) and remained out of effect until readopted in the 110 th Congress. They were again removed from House rules at the beginning of the 112 th Congress (2011-2012). At the time of the adoption of the 1993 rule, then-Minority Leader Robert H. Michel and 12 other Representatives filed suit against the Clerk of the House and the territorial delegates seeking a declaration that the rule was unconstitutional. The constitutionality of the rule was ultimately upheld on appeal based on its inclusion of the mechanism for automatic reconsideration of votes in the House. The votes of the delegates and the resident commissioner were decisive, and thus subject to automatic revote by the House, on three occasions in the 103 rd Congress. There were no instances identified in the 110 th Congress in which the votes of the delegates and the resident commissioner were decisive. In the 111 th Congress, the votes of the delegates were decisive, and subject to an automatic revote, on one occasion. The prior rule governing voting in the Committee of the Whole by delegates and the resident commissioner was not interpreted to mean that any recorded vote with a difference of six votes or fewer was subject to automatic reconsideration. In determining whether the votes of the delegates and the resident commissi oner were decisive, the chair followed a \"but for\" test—namely, would the result of a vote have been different if the delegates and the commissioner had not voted? If the votes of the delegates and resident commissioner on a question were determined to be decisive by this standard, the committee automatically rose and the Speaker put the question to a vote. The vote was first put by voice, and any Representative could, with a sufficient second, obtain a record vote. Once the final result of the vote was announced, the Committee of the Whole automatically resumed its sitting.", "completion": "response:\nAs officers who represent territories and properties possessed or administered by the United States but not admitted to statehood, the five House delegates and the resident commissioner from Puerto Rico do not enjoy all the same parliamentary rights as Members of the House.

During the 115 th Congress, on March 15, 2017, a previously enacted debt limit suspension period expired. On March 16, 2017, the Treasury Department reset the debt limit at $19,809 billion, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin notified Congress that the Treasury Department would use extraordinary measures to temporarily prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations. These measures were in use until September 8, 2017, when President Trump signed P.L. 115-56 , a measure that included a debt limit suspension through December 8, 2017, and reset the debt limit at $20,456 billion. On December 8, 2017, the Treasury Department again implemented extraordinary measures, which estimates suggested would prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations until early March of 2018. On February 9, 2018, a continuing appropriations measure, P.L. 115-123 , was enacted that included the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and, in §30301, a suspension of the federal debt through March 1, 2019.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOn May 29, 1993, at The Hague, 66 nations approved the final text of a multilateral Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, popularly known as the \"Hague Adoption Convention\" (hereinafter \"Convention\"). The purpose of the Convention is to establish uniform standards and procedures that will protect the rights and interests of adopted children, birth parents, and adoptive parents involved in intercountry adoptions. The Convention mandates that each signatory country establish a national Central Authority on adoptions. The Central Authority is to oversee the Convention's implementation in the signatory country and will have an ongoing role in the country's international adoption process. The Convention has three primary features. First, it reinforces the protection of children's rights concerning international adoption. Second, it establishes a mechanism for the cooperation of signatory countries in international adoption. Third, it ensures the recognition of adoptions undertaken and certified through the Convention provisions. The Convention entered into force among participating countries on May 1, 1995. At the present time, the Convention has entered into force in 75 countries. The United States completed the formal ratification procedures on December 12, 2007, and the Convention entered into force on April 1, 2008, in the United States. For the Convention to be fully operative in a participating country, there are three steps which must be fulfilled in sequential order. First, the country must sign the Convention. Second, the country must have a domestic ratification, acceptance, approval, or accession procedure. Third, a formal filing/deposit is required. The instruments of approval (the domestic form of approval) from each country are required to be deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which serves as the depository of the Convention. The United States became a signatory to the Convention on March 31, 1994, which fulfilled the first step. The Convention was transmitted to the Senate for its advice and consent on June 11, 1998. The United States Senate gave its advice and consent to the United States' ratification of the Convention on September 20, 2000. The Senate provided two specific qualifications in its advice and consent to the Convention. One qualification, discussed below, concerned the approval of adoption service providers by federal and state authorities. The second qualification required that the President was not to \"deposit the instrument of ratification for the Convention until such time as the federal law implementing the Convention is enacted and the United States is able to carry out all the obligations of the Convention, as required by its implementing legislation.\" On September 20, 2000, the Senate passed the domestic implementation legislation—the International Adoption Act of 2000 (IAA). The legislation had previously cleared the House on September 18, 2000, and was signed into law by President William J. Clinton on October 6, 2000. The legislation established the domestic administrative framework for the implementation of the provisions of the Convention. Under this framework, the United States opted to permit private agencies to perform adoptive services that are given to the \"Central Authorities\" under the Convention. The U.S. Department of State (DOS), as the Central Authority for the United States (USCA), has many administrative, oversight, and other functions under the Convention. Various administrative actions were required by the DOS to put these functions in place before ratification could be completed. These administrative actions are summarized below. On February 15, 2006, the DOS published the final rules on the accreditation and approval of agencies and persons concerned with the international adoption process in accordance with the Convention. The first body of regulations concerns the approval and accreditation of adoption service providers who wish to provide services in adoption cases subject to the Convention (Part 96). The regulations set out the procedures and the standards that will be used in the approval and the accreditation process. The second body of regulations concerns the federal government's preservation of Convention records (Parts 97, 98). On its website, the DOS summarized the extensive preparations that were necessary to be completed prior to Convention implementation and formal ratification. These included the following: 1) establish and staff the Central Authority within the Office of Children's Issues, Bureau of Consular Affairs; 2) promulgate regulations to (a) establish requirements/procedures for the designation and monitoring of accrediting entities, (b) set the standards that must be met for non-profit adoption agencies to qualify for Convention accreditation and for other agencies and individuals to qualify for Convention approval, (c) govern the registration of smaller community-based agencies for temporary accreditation, and (d) provide the procedures and requirements for incoming and outgoing Convention adoptions involving the United States; 3) establish a case-tracking computer system for intercountry adoptions; 4) designate entities to accredit non-profit U.S. adoption agencies to provide adoption services for Convention adoptions and the related approval of adoption providers; 5) prepare designated accrediting entities to (a) process applications for Convention accreditation and approvals and registration for temporary accreditation, (b) deal with complaints, and (c) continuously monitor the compliance by accredited agencies and approved persons with the requirements of the Convention, the IAA, and the regulations; 6) oversee preparations by accrediting entities and the USCA of the first list of providers authorized under the Convention to offer and provide adoption services for Convention adoptions; 7) establish education materials and programs about Convention adoptions; and 8) deposit the U.S. instrument of ratification and entry into force of the Convention between the United States and other party countries. The DOS completed these preparations in late 2007. On December 12, 2007, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Maura Harty deposited the United States' instrument of ratification of the Convention at a ceremony in The Hague. As a result of this action, the United States is now a full member of the Hague Adoption Convention, which entered into force for the United States on April 1, 2008. The DOS has various ongoing responsibilities with respect to the Convention and intercountry adoption. Annual reports to Congress are required by the IAA concerning certain aspects of the Convention and the IAA implementation. These reports are to be available to the general public and to the Central Authorities of other countries, beginning about one year after the Convention enters into force in the United States. Prior to Convention implementation, adoptions and placements for adoption made in the United States were subject only to state law and procedures, and were not subject to any federal law. IAA and Convention compliance provide new responsibility for state authorities, and necessitate close cooperation and coordination between the DOS and state authorities in order to guarantee that the United States meets its treaty obligations with respect to intercountry adoptions. The United States became a full member of the Convention, and the Convention entered into force on April 1, 2008. The Convention now governs intercountry adoptions between the United States and other Convention member countries in accordance with the provisions of the Intercountry Adoption Act. Prior to ratification, the DOS had numerous duties and responsibilities connected with the implementation of the Convention. The DOS has a continuing role in the operation of the Convention, and has various oversight, reporting, and record-keeping requirements. The DOS maintains a comprehensive website that describes its progress with these activities.", "completion": "response:\nOn April 1, 2008, the United States became a full member of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption (hereinafter \"Convention\"), and the Convention entered into force in the United States.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOn May 9, 2007, President George W. Bush issued National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 51, which is also identified as Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 20 (NSPD 51/HSPD 20), on National Continuity Policy. NSPD 51/HSPD 20 updates longstanding continuity policy expressed in various directives issued by previous administrations to assure that governing entities are able to recover from a wide range of potential operational interruptions. Interruptions for which contingency plans might be activated include localized acts of nature, accidents, technological emergencies, and military or terrorist attack-related incidents. Continuity planning is not unique to government; efforts to assure essential operations are broadly integrated into many private sector industries. As with the private sector, government continuity planning is regarded by some observers as a \"good business practice,\" and part of the fundamental mission of agencies as responsible and reliable public institutions. In the public and private sectors, continuity planning may be viewed as a process that incorporates preparedness capacities ranging from basic emergency preparedness to recovery plans and the resumption of normal operations. Unlike the private sector, however, federal continuity planning also incorporates efforts to maintain and preserve constitutional government, on the assumption that certain essential activities typically provided by government must be carried out with little or no interruption under all circumstances. Examples of those activities include the maintenance of civil authority, support for individuals and firms affected by an incident, infrastructure repair, or other action in support of recovery. Such a response presumes the existence of an ongoing, functional government to fund, support, and oversee recovery efforts. To support the provision of essential government activities, NSPD 51/HSPD 20 sets out a policy \"to maintain a comprehensive and effective continuity capability composed of continuity of operations and continuity of government programs in order to ensure the preservation of our form of government under the Constitution and the continuing performance of national essential functions (NEF) under all conditions.\" The directive identifies eight NEFs that \"are the foundation for all continuity programs and capabilities and represent the overarching responsibilities of the federal government to lead and sustain the Nation during a crisis.\" These are as follows: \"Ensuring the continued functioning of government under the Constitution, including the functioning of the three separate branches of government; \"Providing leadership visible to the Nation and the world and maintaining the trust and confidence of the American people; \"Defending the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and preventing or interdicting attacks against the United States or its people, property, or interests; \"Maintaining and fostering effective relationships with foreign nations; \"Protecting against threats to the homeland and bringing to justice perpetrators of crimes or attacks against the United States or its people, property, or interests; \"Providing rapid and effective response to and recovery from the domestic consequences of an attack or other incident; \"Protecting and stabilizing the Nation's economy and ensuring public confidence in its financial systems; and \"Providing for critical Federal Government services that address the national health, safety, and welfare needs of the United States.\" Since operations may be interrupted without warning, NSPD 51/HSPD 20 requires that continuity planning be incorporated into the daily operations of all executive departments and agencies. Executive branch continuity planning emphasizes \"geographic dispersion of leadership, staff, and infrastructure to alternate facilities to increase survivability and maintain uninterrupted Government Functions.\" The directive requires the application of risk management principles \"to ensure that appropriate operational readiness decisions are based on the probability of an attack or other incident and its consequences.\" By mandating planning based on risk analysis, incorporating continuity activities in day-to-day operations, and mandating the utilization of alternate facilities and staffing, the directive appears to incorporate planning assumptions and approaches used widely in the private sector. NSPD 51/HSPD 20 designates the President to lead the activities of the federal government for ensuring constitutional government, and designates the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism as the National Continuity Coordinator (NCC). In coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and without exercising directive authority, the NCC coordinates the development and implementation of continuity policy for executive branch departments and agencies. In consultation with the heads of appropriate executive departments and agencies, the NCC was required to lead the development of a National Continuity Implementation Plan for submission to the President. NSPD 51/HSPD 20 does not explicitly specify the appropriate departments and agencies. The directive specifies a \"Continuity Policy Coordination Committee (CPCC), chaired by a Senior Director from the Homeland Security Council (HSC) staff\" appointed by the NCC, and designated as the main day-to-day forum for continuity policy coordination, but also indicates that the NCC will coordinate with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The directive designates the Secretary of Homeland Security \"as the President's lead agent for coordinating overall continuity operations and activities of executive departments and agencies.\" Other than explicitly denying the NCC the capacity to exercise directive authority, the extent to which any official charged with continuity coordinating responsibilities can enjoin executive branch agencies to comply with their guidance or recommendations is unclear. NSPD 51/HSPD 20 provides that federal executive branch departments and agencies are \"assigned to a category in accordance with the nature and characteristics of its national security roles and responsibilities in support\" of the NEFs. Agency leaders are required to execute their respective department or agency COOP plans in response to emergencies that affect their operations. In addition, each agency head is required to appoint a senior accountable official, at the assistant secretary level, as the continuity coordinator for the department or agency; identify and submit to the NCC agency mission essential functions and \"develop continuity plans in support of the NEFs and the continuation of essential functions under all conditions;\" plan, program, and budget for continuity capabilities; plan, conduct, and support annual tests and training, to evaluate program readiness and ensure the adequacy and viability of continuity plans and communications systems; and support other continuity requirements, \"in accordance with the nature and characteristics of the agency's national security roles and responsibilities.\" In addition to efforts within the federal executive branch, NSPD 51/HSPD 20 requires the integration of continuity planning with the \"emergency plans and capabilities of state, local, territorial, and tribal governments, and private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure, as appropriate, in order to promote interoperability and to prevent redundancies and conflicting lines of authority,\" and requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate that integration \"to provide for the delivery of essential services during an emergency.\"", "completion": "response:\nOn May 9, 2007, President George W.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nT his report presents information on the constitutional basis for vetoes, veto override procedure, and veto threats. It concludes with tables providing the counts of regular vetoes, pocket vetoes, and vetoes of appropriations acts. The President's veto authority is among the most significant tools in the executive branch's dealings with Congress. The U.S. Constitution outlines the veto authority in Article I, Section 7. Thirty-seven of 44 Presidents have used the veto. Presidents have vetoed 2,572 acts since 1789; of these, Congress has overridden 110 (4.3%). The U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 7) provides that, for a bill to become law, it must be approved by both houses of Congress and presented to the President for approval and signature. Article I, Section 7 also provides the President with the power to veto, or \"forbid,\" the bill from becoming law. The President may sign a bill into law within the 10-day period (excluding Sundays), let the bill become law without signature, or veto the bill. The Constitution states that when the President vetoes a bill, \"he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated.\" For example, if the President vetoes a bill that was introduced in the Senate, the bill will be returned first to the Senate where the possible override process would begin. This type of action is called a \"regular\" or \"return\" veto. If, on the other hand, Congress has adjourned within the 10-day period after presentation of the bill to the President (thereby preventing the return of the bill to Congress), the President may refuse to sign the bill, and the act does not become law—a practice called a \"pocket\" veto. If a bill is pocket vetoed while Congress is out of session, the only way for Congress to circumvent the pocket veto is to reintroduce the legislation as a new bill, pass it through both chambers, and present it to the President again for signature. On the other hand, Congress may override a regular veto without introducing new legislation through the process described in the U.S. Constitution. According to Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution, when the President chooses not to sign a bill and instead returns it to the chamber from where it originated, the chamber enters the message of the President detailing the reasons for his or her refused approval into its Journal and then proceeds \"to reconsider\" the bill. Because the Constitution does not state exactly how Congress should reconsider a vetoed bill, House and Senate procedures govern the specific treatment of acts returned by the President. Passage by a two-thirds margin in both chambers is required to override a veto before the end of the Congress in which the veto is received. If a two-thirds vote is successful in the originating chamber, that chamber informs the other of its decision to override the veto by message. Neither chamber is under any constitutional, legal, or procedural obligation to schedule an override vote. It is not unusual for Congress to make no effort to override the veto if congressional leaders do not believe they have sufficient votes. A veto threat can also prove to be an effective tool for the President, sometimes forcing Congress to modify legislation before presenting the bill to the President. In addition to public addresses concerning legislation, the President has the ability to issue Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs) to express the Administration's view on a bill. SAPs are a written form of communication between the Administration and Congress and are typically issued shortly before floor action on the bill. The Office of Management and Budget coordinates the creation of SAPs on behalf of the Executive Office of the President. SAPs communicate varying levels of Administration support or opposition to a bill. Importantly, SAPs are generally the first formal indicator of the Administration's intent to veto a bill. SAPs containing veto threats contain language indicating either the President's intent to veto, the President being advised to veto by agencies, or the President being advised to veto by the Administration's senior advisors. SAPs are transmitted by the White House to Congress; they are also available on the White House website. Table 1 shows that 37 of 44 Presidents have exercised their veto authority on a total of 2,572 occasions since 1789. Of that number, 1,506 (58.6%) were regular vetoes—that is, the rejected legislation was returned to the congressional chamber of origin, while it was in session, with a presidential message of explanation—and 1,066 (41.5%) were pocket vetoes, or rejected while Congress was adjourned. Congress has overridden 110 (7.3%) of the 1,506 regular vetoes. This percentage is skewed downward by the large number of vetoes prior to the 87 th Congress (which began in 1961). If one counts only the regular vetoes since 1961 (the beginning of the Kennedy Administration), one finds 241 vetoes and 37 overridden (15.4%). George W. Bush (2001-2009) was the first President since John Quincy Adams (1825-1829) to serve a full four-year term without using his veto. No President since Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) has served two full terms without vetoing a bill, as President Bush used his veto in July 2006. President Barack H. Obama has vetoed 10 bills since taking office in 2009. The three most recent vetoes, which all took place during the second session of the 114 th Congress, were of H.R. 3762 , Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015; S.J.Res. 22 , A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval under Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency relating to the definition of \"waters of the United States\" under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; and H.J.Res. 88 , Disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to the definition of the term \"Fiduciary.\" A veto of an appropriations bill can result in a funding gap, which may lead to the closure of federal agencies, the furlough of federal employees, and the interruption of federal programs and services. Despite these potential outcomes, Presidents have vetoed 83 appropriations bills since 1789; more than half of these vetoes have occurred since 1968. For example, Presidents Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton were presented with a total of 387 appropriations acts and vetoed 30 of them (7.8%). President Barack H. Obama has vetoed one appropriations bill. Congressional overrides of vetoes of appropriations are not unusual; 12 of the 83 vetoes (14.5%) have been overridden (see Table 2 ).", "completion": "response:\nThe veto power vested in the President by Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution has proven to be an effective tool in the executive branch's dealings with Congress. In order for a bill to become law, the President either signs the bill into law, or the President allows the bill to become law without signature after a 10-day period. Regular vetoes occur when the President refuses to sign a bill and returns the bill complete with objections to Congress within 10 days. Upon receipt of the rejected bill, Congress is able to begin the veto override process, which requires a two-thirds affirmative vote in both chambers in order for the bill to become law. Pocket vetoes occur when the President receives a bill but is unable to reject and return the bill to an adjourned Congress within the 10-day period. The bill, though lacking a signature and formal objections, does not become law. Pocket vetoes are not subject to the congressional veto override process. Since the founding of the federal government in 1789, 37 of 44 Presidents have exercised their veto authority a total of 2,572 times. Congress has overridden these vetoes on 110 occasions (4.3%). Presidents have vetoed 83 appropriations bills, and Congress has overridden 12 (14.5%) of these vetoes. President Barack H. Obama has vetoed 10 bills since taking office in 2009.

Perkins Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins Act) is the primary federal law aimed at developing and supporting career and technical education (CTE) programs at the secondary and postsecondary educational levels. Prior to the 115 th Congress, the Perkins Act had most recently been reauthorized in 2006 by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270 ). On July 31, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21 st Century Act (Perkins V; P.L. 115-224 ), which comprehensively reauthorized the Perkins Act. Perkins V is the most recent in a series of acts that have reauthorized the main federal law authorizing support for the development of CTE programs aimed at students in secondary and postsecondary education. The provisions of Perkins V go into effect on July 1, 2019. The first year of implementation will be considered a transition year and states will be able to submit transition plans to cover requirements for the July 2019-June 2020 program year. Perkins V authorizes appropriations for CTE programs for FY2019 through FY2024. Following the transition plan, or in lieu of the transition plan, each state must submit a state plan for the period of authorization. The reauthorization of the Perkins Act in the 115 th Congress began in the House, which passed its version of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21 st Century Act ( H.R. 2353 ) by voice vote on June 22, 2017. The Senate passed its own version of the bill by voice vote on July 23, 2018. The House agreed to the Senate version of H.R. 2353 two days later, and the bill was signed into law by the President as P.L. 115-224 . This report does not attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of Perkins V. Rather, it provides an overview of the primary differences between provisions in place under Perkins IV and those enacted in Perkins V. Table 1 compares provisions in Perkins IV with new or revised provisions in Perkins V. It also contains a section that highlights selected definitions that are significantly revised or are introduced in Perkins V. Table A-1 depicts the authorizations of appropriations for programs authorized under the Perkins Act as amended by Perkins V. Table 1 highlights the differences between provisions under Perkins IV and Perkins V as signed into law on July 31, 2018. The table is organized topically, focusing on the areas that will see the most significant changes under Perkins V.

In the 115th Congress, the Perkins Act was comprehensively reauthorized again, through the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V; P.L. 115-224). Perkins V was signed into law by President Trump in July 2018 and is to go into effect on July 1, 2019. Under the Perkins Act, funds for the development and improvement of CTE programs are distributed to states by an allocation formula largely based on population and per capita income factors. States then distribute funds to local CTE providers at the secondary and postsecondary education levels according to within-state allocation formulas specified in statute. Recipients of Perkins funds are required to use them for a variety of purposes that help CTE students attain technical skills and earn an industry-recognized credential, a certificate, or a postsecondary degree. The accountability framework under the Perkins Act requires state and local recipients of Perkins funds to try to achieve target levels of performance on a series of core indicators of performance. The actual levels of performance on each core indicator are reported by the states and disaggregated by a number of special populations and subgroups. If a state fails to meet 90% of any of its target performance levels, it has to implement a program improvement plan for each of the core indicators of performance for which the target performance levels were not met. Perkins V makes a number of changes to the Perkins Act. Some of the key changes include the following: Fund Allocations: The state allocation formula is changed to give each state a base amount equal to its FY2018 allocation. Any additional funds are distributed among the states based on population and per capita income factors, with a greater share going to the states with the smallest initial allocation. Under Perkins V, states are allowed to reserve up to 15% of their allocation for CTE programs in rural areas or areas with high numbers of CTE students, or for innovative CTE programs, instead of 10%, which is the allowance under Perkins IV. Recipient Activities: Provisions in Perkins V require state plans to contain information about how the state's CTE activities will be coordinated with state activities under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Under Perkins V, local CTE providers are required to carry out a needs assessment to better align the offered CTE programs of study with local labor market needs and in-demand occupations. Accountability Framework: Provisions in Perkins V consolidate and modify the secondary and postsecondary core indicators of performance. Under Perkins V, states are allowed to determine their own performance targets on the core indicators of performance, as long as certain minimum requirements are met. In addition to existing data reporting and disaggregation requirements, Perkins V requires states to disaggregate CTE student achievement data by the CTE program or program of study in which the concentrator is enrolled. Program Eliminations: Provisions in Perkins V eliminate Title II of the Perkins Act, known as the Tech Prep program. New Programs: Perkins V introduces a national competitive grant program aimed at identifying, supporting, and evaluating evidence-based and innovative strategies and activities to improve and modernize CTE and align workforce skills with labor market needs."}

The 1994 agreement establishing morning hour debates for a 90-day trial period was later extended to cover the remainder of the 103 rd Congress. Morning hour debates continued in the 104 th Congress under a slightly modified unanimous consent agreement. The modification concerned the length and starting time of morning hour debates on Tuesdays \"after the first Tuesday in May\" (see the \" Days and Meeting Times \" section for more information). An identical unanimous consent agreement (agreed to on January 6, 2009) governs morning hour speeches in the 111 th Congress. Morning hour debates are not provided for in the rules of the House. Instead, they are a unanimous consent practice of the chamber. The House gives unanimous consent to holding morning hour debates when it agrees to the joint leadership unanimous consent agreement governing these debates. In the 111 th Congress, the chair refers to this agreement at the start of the morning hour debate period when he announces, \"[p]ursuant to the order of the House of January 6, 2009, the Chair will now recognize ...\" The unanimous consent agreement governs recognition for morning hour debates and establishes the days and meeting times for these debates (for more information, see later sections of this report). During morning hour debates, Members must abide not only by the unanimous consent agreement but also by the rules of the House, the chamber's precedents, and the Speaker's announced policies. Relevant House rules include those governing debate, decorum, and the Speaker's power of recognition. House precedents discuss how the chamber has interpreted and applied its rules. There is not an established body of precedents for morning hour debates because these debates are a relatively new feature of House floor procedure. The term \"Speaker's announced policies\" refers to the Speaker's policies on certain aspects of House procedure such as decorum in debate, the conduct of electronic votes, and recognition for one-minute and special order speeches. While the Speaker's announced policies do not govern recognition for morning hour debates (the unanimous consent agreement governs recognition), they do regulate television coverage of morning hour debates. The Speaker's policies prohibit House-controlled television cameras from panning the chamber during the morning hour debate period. Instead, a caption (also called a \"crawl\") appears at the bottom of the television screen indicating that the House is conducting morning hour debates. Morning hour debates are in order only on Mondays and Tuesdays. They take place infrequently on Mondays because the House is not always in session that day. The starting time and length of morning hour debates are established by the joint leadership unanimous consent agreement. The House convenes for Monday morning hour debates 90 minutes earlier than the time established for that day's session. For example, if the House is scheduled to meet at noon, the morning hour debate period begins at 10:30 a.m. The Monday morning hour debate period can last up to one hour, with a maximum of 30 minutes of debate on each side. The full hour is rarely used. Tuesday morning hour speeches on or before May 18, 2009, take place in the same manner as Monday morning hour debates. The agreement provides, however, that Tuesday morning hour debates after May 18, 2009, begin 60 minutes before the chamber's meeting hour for a maximum duration of 50 minutes, with 25 minutes allocated to each side. The different procedures for Tuesday morning debates after early May were first established in the joint leadership unanimous consent agreement of May 12, 1995. These procedures, which are included in the agreement for the 111 th Congress, are designed to accommodate the chamber's practice of convening earlier for legislative business after early May. In the 105 th Congress, the procedures were only on those Tuesdays after early May when the House was scheduled to meet at 10:00 a.m. On Tuesdays after early May when the chamber's appointed meeting hour was a later time (e.g., 12:00 noon), the Tuesday morning debates took place in the same manner as Monday morning hour debates. When Monday and Tuesday morning hour debates are completed, the House recesses until the meeting hour established for that day's session. The daily prayer, the pledge of allegiance, and approval of the previous day's Journal take place when the House meets after this recess. The joint leadership unanimous consent agreement requires that the majority and minority leaders give the Speaker a list showing how each party's time for morning hour debates will be allocated among its Members. The chair follows this list in recognizing Members for morning hour debates. A majority party Representative appointed as \"Speaker pro tempore \" often presides in the chair during morning hour debates. During each morning hour debate period, he alternates recognition between the majority and minority for both the initial morning hour speech (i.e., if a majority Member is recognized for the first speech on Monday, a minority Member is recognized for first speech on Tuesday) and subsequent ones. Individual Members must limit their morning hour debate speech to five minutes or less. Only the majority leader, minority leader, or the minority whip may deliver a morning hour debate speech longer than five minutes. Members reserve time for morning hour debates through their party leadership: Democratic Representatives reserve time through the Office of the Minority Leader, and Republican Members do so through the Republican cloakroom or the party leadership desk on the House floor. Reservations can be made no earlier than one week before the speech date. While most Members reserve five minutes for their morning hour speech, some Representatives reserve as little as one minute. Individual Members often use the morning hour debate period to deliver speeches on subjects unrelated to legislation before the House. They deliver eulogies and tributes to individuals and organizations from their congressional district. They also use the period to deliver speeches on broad policy issues and to present their views on local, national, and international events. Because morning hour debates take place early in the day, they are sometimes used by individual Members and the party leadership to share information relevant to that day's session. For example, Members deliver morning hour speeches to explain a bill they are introducing that day and to invite cosponsors. The chairman of the Rules Committee has spoken during morning hour debates to announce an emergency meeting of the committee. This use of morning hour debates to disseminate information among colleagues parallels how Members often employ one-minute speeches as a visual form of the \"Dear Colleague\" letter. On occasion, Members of the same party use the morning hour debate period to deliver a series of speeches about the party's views on a particular bill or policy issue. For example, on February 11, 1997, four minority party Members delivered morning hour debate speeches on campaign finance reform. This coordinated use of morning hour debates by party Members is similar to how the parties sometimes use \"leadership special orders\" (i.e., the first hour of longer special orders that is usually reserved for the party's leadership or a designee) to focus on a specific theme with participation from other party Members.", "completion": "response:\nOn Mondays and Tuesdays, the House of Representatives meets earlier than the hour established for that day's session for a period called \"morning hour debates\" (also known as \"morning hour speeches\"). This period provides a rare opportunity for non-legislative debate in the House; remarks in the House are usually limited to pending legislative business. During morning hour debates, individual Members deliver speeches on topics of their choice for up to five minutes. The majority and minority leaders give the Speaker a list showing how each party's time for morning hour debates will be allocated among its Members. The chair follows this list in recognizing Members for morning hour debates. At the conclusion of morning hour debates, the House recesses until the starting time for that day's session. This report examines current House practices for morning hour debates and how these debates are used. It will be updated if rules and procedures change."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nT he Senate takes up business under procedures set in Senate rules and by long-standing custom, thereby giving it flexibility in setting its floor agenda. This report first discusses those processes or customs most often used by the Senate and then discusses some procedures less often used to call up business. Under chamber rules, technically any Senator may offer the necessary agenda-setting motions \"to proceed to the consideration\" of a bill, resolution, or item of executive business. However, by long-established custom, in practice only the majority leader or his or her designee offer agenda-setting motions. (See CRS Report RS21255, Motions to Proceed to Consider Measures in the Senate: Who Offers Them? , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].) Items called up are often those on the Senate's legislative or executive calendars, either reported by committee or, in the case of bills and joint resolutions, placed on the legislative calendar directly under Rule XIV (see CRS Report RS22309, Senate Rule XIV Procedure for Placing Measures Directly on the Senate Calendar , by [author name scrubbed]). Holds, long recognized by custom, are notices from Senators to their party floor leaders that they intend to object to a unanimous consent request to bring a matter up for consideration on the Senate floor. Holds also serve to identify controversial bills or controversial items within a bill (s ee CRS Report R43563, \"Holds\" in the Senate , by [author name scrubbed]). Leaders also invite Senators to file \"requests to be consulted\" with the staff of the respective party secretaries. Through these requests, Senators join in talks about compromise versions of bills and potential amendments, the Senate's floor schedule, and conditions of floor action. When consulted Senators no longer report any concerns, a bill is said to have \"cleared both sides of the aisle.\" Such bills are generally called up by unanimous consent, considered, and agreed to by voice vote with little or no actual floor debate. Through negotiations inherent in the hold and consultation process, floor leaders can often get Senators to agree to take up a bill despite the reservations some have about key provisions in it. Thus, usually, the majority leader or his or her designee will ask unanimous consent to proceed to the consideration of a measure pending on the Senate calendar. Alternatively, the majority leader may move to proceed to the consideration of the measure or matter. Normally, this motion is debatable. Debate on the motion can be ended only by unanimous consent or by invoking cloture. If the motion to proceed is agreed to, consideration of the bill begins without debate limits (unless also imposed by unanimous consent or cloture). There are few circumstances in which a motion to proceed is not debatable. Motions to take up certain privileged items of business (discussed in the next section) are not debatable. Although infrequently used, debate is also prohibited on motions to proceed offered on the beginning of a new legislative day during the \"morning hour\" after the completion of \"morning business.\" Under Senate Rule VIII, a two-hour period known as the morning hour occurs automatically at the beginning of a new legislative day, and within this two-hour period, a period is reserved for the transaction of morning business, such as the filing of committee reports and the receipt of executive communications. Under this Rule VIII procedure, the motion to proceed is not debatable if offered during the morning hour. If the motion is agreed to, the measure becomes the pending business before the Senate. At the end of the morning hour, any unfinished legislative business pending on the previous day when the Senate adjourned will displace the measure just taken up. The non-debatable motion to proceed under Rule VIII poses many parliamentary difficulties and is, therefore, rarely used by the majority leader. In actual practice, the Senate almost always begins a new legislative day under procedures established by unanimous consent, rather than relying on the automatic procedures for a morning hour contained in Rule VIII. Such unanimous consent agreements commonly include a stipulation that the morning hour be \"deemed to have expired.\" Motions to take up privileged items of business are not debatable and, hence, are usually taken up by unanimous consent. Among the items of privileged business are budget resolutions, reconciliation bills, conference reports, measures to resolve election contests, and measures to impose disciplinary sanctions against Senators. Motions to go into executive session to consider a nomination, treaty, or resolution on the Senate Executive Calendar are also privileged and non-debatable. On the motion of any Senator, a measure or matter can be made a special order of business at some future specified date. Such motions are very rarely used, because they are fully debatable and need a two-thirds vote for approval. If there is objection to considering a resolution when it is submitted, the resolution is said to \"go over, under the rule,\" and is placed on a special section of the Calendar of Business reserved for this purpose. Such resolutions are to be laid before the Senate on the next legislative day during the morning business period (described above), which would occur automatically under Rule VIII. Items pending at the end of morning business return to the Calendar of Business and can be called up later by a debatable motion or unanimous consent. In current practice, however, few resolutions go \"over, under the rule,\" and because (as noted above) the Senate almost never engages in morning business created by the beginning of a new legislative day as called for under Rule VIII, those resolutions that do are essentially placed in a kind of parliamentary limbo. They remain pending on the Calendar of Business, unreachable except by unanimous consent or by a rare morning hour created by operation of the rule. Executive resolutions that are placed on the Executive Calendar \"over, under the rule\" can be subsequently reached by unanimous consent or, as noted above, by non-debatable motion. Motions to discharge committees from the further consideration of any measure or matter (for example, a nomination or treaty) must lie over for one day, and debate on such a motion is not limited. As such, three-fifths of all Senators may need to vote for cloture in order for the chamber to reach a final vote on the motion. (For more information on nomination procedures, see CRS Report RL31980, Senate Consideration of Presidential Nominations: Committee and Floor Procedure , by [author name scrubbed].) If agreed to, a motion to discharge would place a measure or matter on the relevant chamber calendar.", "completion": "response:\nThe Senate takes up measures and matters under procedures set in Senate rules and by long-standing customs, thereby giving it flexibility in setting its floor agenda.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOn August 31, 2010, President Obama announced that the U.S. combat mission in Iraq had ended. More than 100,000 troops have been withdrawn from Iraq, and a transitional force of U.S. troops has remained in Iraq with a different mission: \"advising and assisting Iraq's Security Forces, supporting Iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilians.\" This mission is called Operation New Dawn (OND). Table 1 provides statistics on fatalities and wounds in OND. All troops are slated for withdrawal from Iraq by the end of 2011. Table 2 provides statistics on fatalities and wounds during Operation Iraqi Freedom, which began on March 19, 2003, and ended August 31, 2010. Statistics may be revised as circumstances surrounding a servicemember's death or injury are investigated and as all records are processed through the U.S. military's casualty system. More frequent updates are available at DOD's website at http://www.defense.gov/news/casualty.pdf . A detailed casualty summary that includes data on deaths by cause, as well as statistics on soldiers wounded in action, is available at DOD's website at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/castop.htm . According to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq's (UNAMI's) tally, 2,953 Iraqi civilians were killed and 10,434 were injured during 2010. In comparison, according to the same source, 3,056 civilians were killed and 10,770 civilians wounded in 2009. UNAMI also reports figures provided to UNAMI from the Iraq Ministry of Human Rights. According to these figures, 3,254 Iraqi civilians died and 13,788 were wounded in 2010. A separate report from the Iraq Ministry of Human Rights, published in October of 2009, gave figures of 85,694 civilian deaths from 2004 to 2008. The 2009 report specified that it included only those deaths due to terrorist attacks, defined as \"direct bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and forced displacement of the population.\" In other words, the Iraq Ministry of Human Rights did not include in its 2009 total any civilian deaths that may have been due to coalition occupation or fighting between militias within Iraq. It is not clear whether this distinction was made with the 2010 data reported by UNAMI. Added together, the Iraq Ministry of Human Rights would seem to have a tally of 88,948 Iraqi civilian deaths from 2004 through 2010. Along with the Iraq Ministry of Human Rights, other Iraqi ministries also have kept data on civilian deaths. The Iraq Health Ministry releases data on civilian deaths and the Iraq Ministries of the Interior and Defense release data on police and security forces deaths. Each of these ministries releases their data to the press on a monthly basis. According to their totals, 9,466 civilians and 2,238 Iraqi police and security forces have died since January 2008. Figure 1 charts the deaths of civilians and police and security forces as reported by the Iraq Ministry of Health. The Iraq Body Count (IBC) website bases its casualty estimates on media reports of casualties, some of which may involve security forces as well as civilians. Using media reports as a base for casualty estimates can entail errors: some deaths may not be reported in the media, whereas other deaths may be reported more than once. The IBC documents each of the civilian casualties it records with a media source and provides a minimum and a maximum estimate. As of November 21, 2011, the IBC estimated that between 103,640 and 113,230 civilians had died as a result of military action. In a separate analysis of its data, the IBC also estimated that, between January 2006 and November 2008, 4,884 Iraqi police had been killed. A separate analysis used IBC data to look at Iraqi civilian deaths caused by perpetrators of armed violence during the first five years of the Iraq War. The researchers found that coalition forces caused 12% of civilian deaths, anti-coalition forces caused 11%, and unknown perpetrators caused 74%. In addition, they applied a \"Dirty War Index\" (DWI) and found that the most indiscriminate effects on women and children were from unknown perpetrators firing mortars, non-suicide vehicle bombs, and coalition air attacks. They concluded that \"coalition forces had a higher DWI than anti-coalition forces for all weapons combined, with no decrease over the study period.\" The Iraq Coalition Casualty Count (ICCC) is another nonprofit group that, like the IBC, tracks Iraqi civilian and Iraqi security forces deaths using media reports of deaths. ICCC is also prone to the kind of errors likely to occur when using media reports for data: some deaths may not be reported, whereas other deaths may be reported more than once. The ICCC estimates that there were 50,152 civilian deaths from March 2005 through July 2011, and 8,825 security forces were killed from January 2005 to July 2011. Earlier studies include \"the Lancet study.\" In 2006, researchers from Johns Hopkins University and Baghdad's Al-Mustansiriya University published their most recent cluster study on Iraqi civilian casualties, commonly referred to in the press as \"the Lancet study\" because it was published in the British medical journal of that name. The study surveyed 47 clusters and reported an estimate of between 426,369 and 793,663 Iraqi civilian deaths from violent causes since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom to July 2006. In a more recent cluster study, a team of investigators from the Federal Ministry of Health in Baghdad, the Kurdistan Ministry of Planning, the Kurdistan Ministry of Health, the Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology in Baghdad, and the World Health Organization formed the Iraq Family Health Survey (IFHS) Study Group to research violence-related mortality in Iraq. In their nationally representative cluster study, interviewers visited 89.4% of 1,086 household clusters; the household response rate was 96.2%. They concluded that there had been an estimated 151,000 violence-related deaths from March 2003 through June 2006 and that violence was the main cause of death for men between the ages of 15 and 59 during the first three years after the 2003 invasion. This study seems to be widely cited for violence-related mortality rates in Iraq. Neither the Lancet study nor the IFHS study distinguish among different victims of violence, such as civilians versus police or security force members. The studies do not reflect trends that occurred during the period of the most intense civil violence from early 2006 through the end of 2008. In 2007, a British firm, Opinion Research Business (ORB), conducted a survey in Iraq in which it asked 2,411 Iraqis, \"How many members of your household, if any, have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 (i.e., as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age)? Please note that I mean those who were actually living under your roof?\" Extrapolating from its results, OBR estimated \"that over 1,000,000 Iraqi citizens have died as a result of the conflict which started in 2003.\" Finally, the Brookings Institution has used numbers from the following sources to develop its own composite estimate for Iraqi civilians, police, and security forces who have died by violence: the U.N. Human Rights Report , the Iraq Body Count, the U.S. Central Command's General David Petraeus's congressional testimony given on September 10-11, 2007, Iraqi government sources, and other sources. By combining all of these sources by date, the Brookings Institution estimates that between May 2003 and July 2011, 115,515 Iraqi civilians died and between June 2003 and July 2011, 10,125 Iraqi police and security forces died. Table 4 provides Iraqi civilian, security forces, and police officers casualty estimates from nongovernmental sources. These estimates are based on varying time periods and have been created using differing methodologies, and therefore readers should exercise caution when using and comparing these statistics.", "completion": "response:\nThis report presents U.S. military casualties in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation New Dawn (OND) as well as governmental and nongovernmental estimates of Iraqi civilian, police, and security forces casualties. For several years, there were few estimates from any national or international government source regarding Iraqi civilian, police, and security forces casualties. Now, however, United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) is reporting civilian casualty estimates. In addition, several Iraqi ministries have released monthly or total casualty statistics. Nongovernmental sources also have released various estimates of Iraqi civilian, police, and security forces casualties. This report includes estimates from Iraq Body Count (IBC), the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count (ICCC), Iraq Family Health Survey (IFHS), the most recent study published in the Lancet, the Brookings Institution, and the British survey firm, Opinion Research Business (ORB). Because the estimates of Iraqi casualties contained in this report are based on varying time periods and have been created using differing methodologies, readers should exercise caution when using them and should look to them as guideposts rather than as statements of fact. This report will be updated as needed."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nBoth chambers of Congress have passed comprehensive legislation to reauthorize expiring programs at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to expand the agency's authority to help ensure the safety of certain medical products. The bills are the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act ( S. 1082 ) and the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 ( H.R. 2900 ). S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 represent the most comprehensive FDA legislation since the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA; P.L. 105-115 ). The primary driver of the legislation is the renewal of FDA's authority for two key user fee programs set to expire at the end of FY2007: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA; P.L. 107-188 ) and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250 ). FDA had reportedly urged Congress to complete its reauthorization efforts before August 1, 2007 (rather than by the program's termination date of October 1, 2007), because of a requirement that FDA notify employees at least 60 days in advance of layoffs, which would be necessary without PDUFA and MDUFMA funds. The media report that FDA has switched to reserve funds to forestall the issuance of layoff notifications, the effect of which is a hiring freeze at FDA. In addition, the FDA Commissioner has reportedly stressed that the funding uncertainty is harming the morale of employees—30% of which are at a point where they can retire. The bills also would reauthorize two other expiring authorities, which are related to pediatric pharmaceuticals: the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA; P.L. 105-115 ), reauthorized in P.L. 107-109, and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA; P.L. 108-155 ). In addition, the bills address a number of other issues of concern to Congress and the public. This report presents a side-by-side analysis of S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 , highlighting the differences between the bills. It contains individual tables on topics covered by the bills, including prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, medical device regulation, pediatric exclusivity incentives (BPCA), mandatory pediatric assessments (PREA), pediatric medical devices, drug safety, antibiotic drugs, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, importation of prescription drugs, a new Reagan-Udall Foundation, food safety, domestic pet turtle market access, and other provisions. In general, provisions in the two bills amend FDA's authorities in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) or the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Unless otherwise noted, mention of \"the Secretary\" in the following tables refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For background information on the impetus for this legislation and for an overview of the two bills, see CRS Report RL34089, FDA Legislation in the 110 th Congress: A Guide to S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed].", "completion": "response:\nBoth the House and the Senate have passed comprehensive legislation to reauthorize existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) programs and expand the agency's authority to ensure the safety of prescription drugs, medical devices, and biologics. The Senate passed the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act (S. 1082) on May 9, 2007. The House passed the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (H.R. 2900) on July 11, 2007. At its core, the legislation renews authority for two key user fee programs that are set to expire on October 1, 2007: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA; P.L. 107-188) and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250). These account for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of FDA's total FY2008 program level budget. Without the reauthorizations, and absent a substantial increase in FDA's annual appropriations, the agency would lose a significant source of funding. FDA had warned that a failure to reauthorize the user fee programs before August 1, 2007, would require the agency to issue layoff notices, but the agency has reportedly forestalled that necessity by switching to reserve funds. In addition to user fee programs, the bills reauthorize two other FDA authorities related to prescription drugs for pediatric populations, which are also set to expire on October 1, 2007: the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA; P.L. 107-109) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA; P.L. 108-155). These laws provide marketing exclusivity incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of on-patent and off-patent drugs. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 also contain provisions related to drug safety, pediatric medical devices, clinical trial registration, and the creation of a new nonprofit entity to assist FDA with its mission. The bills' overlapping provisions are similar, but not identical. S. 1082 contains some additional provisions that are not present in H.R. 2900, on the topics of food safety, prescription drug importation, and domestic pet turtle market access. Attempts to expand the legislation to address several other FDA-related issues, for example, follow-on biologics and genetic testing, have thus far been unsuccessful. Differences between the bills may be addressed in conference. This report contains a side-by-side comparison of S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, and includes links to relevant CRS reports.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOn May 22, 1998, President William J. Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 62 (PDD 62)—Protection Against Unconventional Threats to the Homeland and Americans Overseas. PDD 62 established a framework for federal department and agency counter-terrorism programs, which addressed terrorist apprehension and prosecution, increased transportation security, enhanced emergency response, and enhanced cyber security. PDD 62 also designated specific federal departments and agencies as the lead agencies in the event of terrorist attacks. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) was designated as the lead agency with the leadership role in the planning, implementation, and coordination of operational security for events of national significance—as designated by the President. Other lead agencies for counter terrorism activities included the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Health and Human Services. On December 19, 2000, Congress enacted P.L. 106 - 544 , the Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000, and authorized USSS—when directed by the President—to plan, coordinate, and implement security operations at special events of national significance. The special events were entitled National Special Security Events (NSSEs). Some events categorized as NSSE include presidential inaugurations, major international summits held in the United States, major sporting events, and presidential nominating conventions. Prior to the establishment of DHS in January 2003, the President determined what events of national significance were designated as NSSEs. Since the establishment of the department, the DHS Secretary—as the President's representative—has had the responsibility to designate NSSEs. NSSE designation factors include: anticipated attendance by U.S. officials and foreign dignitaries; size of the event; and significance of the event. Recent NSSEs include the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama, the Republican and Democratic Presidential Candidate Nominating Conventions in 2008, and the state funeral of former President Gerald Ford on January 3, 2007. When an event is designated an NSSE, USSS becomes the lead federal agency in developing, exercising, and implementing security operations. The goal of these security operations is to \"develop and implement a seamless security plan that will create a safe and secure environment for the general public, event participants, Secret Service protectees, and other dignitaries.\" The USSS's Major Events Division (MED) is responsible for NSSE planning and coordinates with other USSS headquarters and field offices. Some of the coordination includes advance planning and liaison for venue and air space security, training, communications, and security credentialing. Additionally, MED coordinates and conducts liaisons with other federal, state, and local agencies—primarily law enforcement entities. NSSE security is planned, exercised, and implemented through a unified command model that is comprised of representatives of participating federal, state, and local agencies with NSSE responsibilities. During the NSSE's planning phase, each participating agency is tasked according to their expertise or jurisdictional responsibility. USSS states that, \"with the support of hundreds of federal, state, and local law enforcement and public safety organizations, each of these events has successfully concluded without any major incidents.\" NSSE operational plans include the use of physical infrastructure security fencing, barricades, special access accreditation badges, K-9 teams, and other security technologies. To ensure consequence management, DHS prepositions Domestic Emergency Support Teams, Urban Search and Rescue Teams, national Emergency Response Teams, Nuclear Incident Response Teams, and the Strategic National Stockpile and Mobile Emergency Response System. Specific teams and groupings of teams are designed for each event based on coordination with other federal entities, state and local jurisdictions, available local resources, and mutual aid agreements. Additionally, USSS sponsors training seminars for command-level federal, state, and local law enforcement and public safety officials to provide principles for managing security at major events and strategies for reducing vulnerabilities related to terrorism. The seminars also discuss key strategies and lessons learned from past NSSEs. Even though NSSEs have been conducted since 1998, Congress has only appropriated funding specifically for a general NSSE fund since FY2006. Congress has, however, appropriated funding for five specific NSSEs. The first two were the 2004 Democratic and Republican presidential nominating conventions in Boston, MA, and New York City, NY, respectively. The next two were the 2008 Democratic and Republican nominating conventions in Denver, CO, and Minneapolis - St. Paul, MN, respectively. The 108 th Congress appropriated a total of $100 million for presidential nominating convention security at these two events. This $100 million was administered through the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Enforcement Assistance Programs (the Byrne programs). DOJ used the majority of this funding to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities for overtime costs because USSS did not have a mechanism to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities for NSSE security costs. The most recent NSSE funding was $15 million for \"emergency planning and security costs\" for the District of Columbia which was used for the January 20, 2009, inauguration of President Barack Obama. Additionally, former President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency for the District of Columbia, which authorizes the federal government to reimburse the District for emergency preparedness activities and expenditures that exceed the $15 million Congress appropriated in P.L. 110 - 329 . Additionally, Congress appropriated, in the FY2009 omnibus, $39.2 million for emergency planning and security costs in the District, however, this funding is not specifically for NSSEs. Federal funding for National Special Security Events (NSSE) costs incurred by federal, state, and local entities is one issue Congress may wish to address. In FY2008, Congress appropriated $1 million for NSSE costs within the Secret Service. Some might argue that the $1 million Congress has annually appropriated for NSSEs in the past couple of fiscal years may not have be adequate to fund NSSE expenditures, such as the recent presidential inauguration. The amount appropriated could be additionally problematic considering that the Secret Service is not authorized to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities' overtime costs associated with NSSEs. Any security costs incurred by the Secret Service could be funded with appropriations specifically designated for the agency, whereas federal reimbursement of any security costs incurred by state and local jurisdictions would have to be appropriated through other federal assistance programs—such as the $100 million appropriated for the 2008 presidential nominating conventions through DOJ's Office of Justice Programs. Congress might consider establishing a program within Secret Service that not only provides the agency with additional funds for unexpected NSSE security costs, but also authorizes the Secret Service to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities for security costs. Presently, state and local jurisdictions can use DHS grants, such as the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) and the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) for NSSE security activities. The grant approval process for these programs, however, is not flexible, so the programs have limited application to NSSEs. States and localities would need to plan SHSGP and UASI funding for NSSE security annually in their grant applications. For unexpected NSSEs—which may be the result of an unexpected death of a President or a change in location of a planned NSSE—states and localities are unable to plan use SHSGP or UASI funds to in advance for security costs. DHS does authorize states and localities to reprogram SHSGP and UASI funding with the DHS Secretary's approval; however, that may result in states and localities not funding other planned homeland security activities.", "completion": "response:\nMajor events that are considered to be nationally significant may be designated by the President—or his representative, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)—as National Special Security Events (NSSE). Beginning in September 1998 through February 2008, there have been 28 events designated as NSSEs. Some of these events have included presidential inaugurations, presidential nominating conventions, major sports events, and major international meetings. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) is the lead federal agency responsible for coordinating, planning, exercising, and implementing security for NSSEs, and was designated as the lead agency in P.L. 106-544.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nRecent high energy prices, concerns over energy security, and the desire to promote rural business and to reduce air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions have sparked congressional interest in promoting greater use of alternatives to petroleum fuels. Biofuels—transportation fuels produced from plant and animal materials—have attracted particular interest. Ethanol and biodiesel, the two most widely used biofuels, receive significant federal support in the form of tax incentives, loan and grant programs, and regulatory programs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct, P.L. 109-58 ) established a renewable fuel standard (RFS). This initial RFS required the increasing use of renewable fuel in gasoline, starting at 4.0 billion gallons in 2006 and increasing to 7.5 billion gallons in 2012. However, the RFS was significantly expanded on December 19, 2007, when President Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). Instead of requiring 5.4 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008, the new law requires 9.0 billion gallons. Further, the 2007 law requires that the RFS be expanded to 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022, as compared to an estimated 8.6 billion gallons under EPAct. Although this is not an explicit ethanol mandate, it is expected that much of this requirement will be met using corn-based ethanol. The U.S. ethanol industry expanded rapidly in response to EPAct, outpacing the required growth in the earlier RFS and leading some proponents of corn-based ethanol to support an increase in the mandated levels of the RFS. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 farm bill, P.L. 110-246 ) promotes the development of cellulosic ethanol production through new tax credits, reduces slightly the blender's tax credit for corn-derived ethanol beginning in 2009, and continues the tariff on imported ethanol. It also expands research on agricultural renewable energy and encourages infrastructure development needed for cellulosic ethanol production. During the final months of the farm bill debate, both food and fuel prices increased dramatically, and the role of corn-based ethanol in food price inflation became the subject of intense debate. Because of the rapid expansion of U.S. corn ethanol capacity—as of December 2008, existing capacity was an estimated at 10.4 billion gallons per year, while an additional 1.8 billion gallons was under construction —some are concerned that the United States will soon reach the limit of ethanol that can be produced from corn. Critics of corn-based ethanol argue that the industry does not need continued government support, and that current corn demand for ethanol is putting a strain on corn and other grain markets, leading to increases in other commodity prices, such as livestock feed, which then leads to higher dairy and meat prices. Critics also argue that the environmental costs of corn-based ethanol may outweigh the benefits. Proponents of corn-based ethanol production assert that increased acreage and upward-trending yields will enable corn producers to satisfy the demand for corn for feed, fuel, and exports. Advanced biofuels based on non-food feedstocks are generating much interest. Feedstocks that could be grown on marginal land with reduced inputs compared with corn would solve the food versus fuel issue, it has been argued. However, biofuels that rely on other sources of biomass, including agricultural wastes, municipal solid waste, and dedicated non-food energy crops such as perennial grasses, fast-growing trees, and algae are still years from commercial production. Nonetheless, this interest has led to proposals to support and/or mandate biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch through explicit requirements, research, development and extension funding, and/or tax incentives. Non-corn biofuels could include fuels produced from cellulosic material (such as perennial grasses), ethanol produced from sugarcane or beets, and biodiesel or renewable diesel produced from vegetable or animal oils. Under EISA, eligible corn-based ethanol production is capped at 15 billion gallons beginning in 2015. Starting in 2009, the RFS will require that an increasing amount of the mandate be met through the use of \"advanced biofuels\"—biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch. Currently, cellulosic ethanol is not produced on a commercial scale. As of July 2008, there was one commercial-scale refinery under construction, with two demonstration-scale plants and three pilot-scale plants completed. Industry sources expect commercial production of cellulosic ethanol to begin in 2010 or 2011. In January 2009, USDA announced funding for a cellulosic biofuels plant under the Biorefinery Program with projected output of 20 million gallons annually, beginning in 2010. The RFS mandates cellulosic ethanol production of 100 million gallons in 2010. For more information on cellulosic ethanol, see CRS Report RL34738, Cellulosic Biofuels: Analysis of Policy Issues for Congress , by Tom Capehart. The following table provides a side-by-side comparison of biofuels-related provisions in EISA with the enacted farm bill—the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. President Bush signed EISA on December 19, 2007, and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 became law on June 18, 2008, after President Bush's veto was overridden by both the Senate and the House. Both bills cover a wide range of energy and agricultural topics in addition to biofuels. The table is organized in the same order as EISA, followed by provisions that are exclusively in the enacted farm bill. Key biofuels-related provisions of EISA and the 2008 farm bill include: a major expansion of the renewable fuel standard (RFS) established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ) [EISA]; expansion and/or modification of tax credits for ethanol [farm bill]; grants and loan guarantees for biofuels (especially cellulosic) research, development, deployment, and production [EISA, farm bill]; studies of the potential for ethanol pipeline transportation, expanded biofuel use, market and environmental impacts of increased biofuel use, and the effects of biodiesel on engines [EISA, farm bill]; expansion of biofuel feedstock availability [farm bill]; reauthorization of biofuels research and development at the U.S. Department of Energy [EISA] and the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency [farm bill]; and reduction of the blender tax credit for corn-based ethanol, a new production tax credit for cellulosic ethanol, and continuation of the import duty on ethanol [farm bill].", "completion": "response:\nThe Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140), also known as the 2007 energy bill, significantly expands existing programs to promote biofuels.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nPresident Bush signed S. 714 , the Junk Fax Prevention Act (\"the act\" or JFPA), on July 9, 2005. This law vacated previous rules promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in July 2003 relating to unsolicited facsimile (fax) advertising; those rules amended section 227 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 227). The JFPA contains the following specific provisions relating to fax advertising. Provides an \"established business relationship\" (EBR) exemption, allowing businesses, political organizations, and trade associations to send advertisements and solicitations to persons with whom they have an existing relationship. Requires organizations to place a \"clear and conspicuous\" notice on the first page of each fax informing the recipient how to opt out of future faxes—the notice must include U.S. telephone and fax numbers and a \"cost-free\" way for recipients to make their requests. Requires that businesses be able to accept opt-out requests 24-hours a day, seven days a week. The JFPA also directed the FCC to conduct a rulemaking to implement certain portions of the act (see below, \" FCC Activity \") and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to issue a report on the effectiveness of the FCC's junk fax enforcement policies by April 5, 2006 (see below, \" GAO Activity \"). The JFPA required the FCC to adopt rules concerning unsolicited fax advertising as well as issue an annual report on its enforcement activities. On December 9, 2005, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and Order on various questions related to the regulation of commercial faxes. On April 5, 2006, the FCC adopted its final rules in this proceeding. These rules codified an exemption to the fax rules to allow fax advertisements to be sent to parties with whom the sender has an EBR and provided a definition of an EBR to be used in the context of sending fax advertisements; required that, even in the case of an EBR, a person sending a fax advertisement must obtain the fax number directly from the recipient or ensure that the recipient voluntarily agreed to make the number available for public distribution; required the sender of fax advertisements to provide clear and conspicuous notice and contact information on the first page of a fax that allows recipients to \"opt-out\" of future fax transmissions from the sender; required senders to honor opt-out requests within the shortest reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days; determined not to exempt small businesses or nonprofit trade associations from the rules; and clarified the term \"unsolicited advertisement.\" In this proceeding, the FCC did not address whether there should be a time limit on the duration of an EBR, although the act allows the FCC to revisit that issue at another time. The FCC's Junk Fax Fact Sheet is available online at http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/unwantedfaxes.html . As required by the JFPA, in January 2007, the FCC released its first annual report on junk fax enforcement. According to the report, the Commission issued 125 citations in response to 47,704 junk fax complaints representing 102,004 alleged violations during the period July 2005 through July 2006. The report further states that the Commission fully addressed approximately 85 percent of those alleged violations, but that figure includes not only complaints against which the FCC issued a citation, but also violations that were found to be non-actionable for various reasons. As required under the JFPA, on April 5, 2006, the GAO submitted its report to Congress on the FCC's enforcement of the junk fax law. The report addressed the following. The FCC's junk fax procedures and outcomes. The strengths and weaknesses of FCC's procedures. The FCC's junk fax management challenges. The GAO found that the FCC had instituted procedures for receiving and acknowledging the increasing number of junk fax complaints, but that the numbers of investigations and enforcement actions had remained mostly the same. For example, the GAO stated that in 2000, the FCC recorded about 2,200 junk fax complaints; in 2005, the FCC recorded over 46,000 complaints. However, in total, the GAO found that the FCC's Enforcement Bureau issued only 261 warnings from 2000 through 2005. Further, the GAO discovered that although the bureau had ordered six companies to pay forfeitures totaling over $6.9 million for continuing to violate the junk fax rules after receiving warnings, none of that total had been collected by the Department of Justice. The GAO also stated that FCC officials cited competing demands, resource constraints, and the rising sophistication of violators in hiding their identities as hindrances to enforcement. With respect to strengths and weaknesses in the FCC's procedures, the GAO determined that an emphasis on customer service, an effort to document consumers' complaints, and an attempt to target enforcement resources efficiently were strengths in FCC's procedures; however, inefficient data management, resulting in time-consuming manual data entry, data errors, and—most importantly—the exclusion of the majority of complaints from decisions about investigations and enforcement, continue to be weaknesses. Further, the GAO stated that the FCC does not provide consumers with adequate guidance or information to support the FCC's enforcement efforts. Finally, the GAO stated that FCC faces management challenges in carrying out its junk fax responsibilities. The FCC has no clearly articulated long-term or annual goals for junk fax monitoring and enforcement, and it is not analyzing the data it collects. Without analysis, the FCC cannot assess whether it needs to change its rules, procedures, or consumer guidance guidelines. Most importantly, the GAO found that without performance goals and measures and without analysis of complaint and enforcement data, it was not possible to explore the effectiveness of current enforcement measures.", "completion": "response:\nOn July 9, 2005, President Bush signed S. 714, the Junk Fax Prevention Act (\"the act\" or JFPA) (P.L. 109-21) and on April 5, 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued its final rules in the related proceeding. These rules provided an established business relationship (EBR) exemption to the prohibition on sending unsolicited facsimile advertisements; provided a definition of an EBR to be used in the context of unsolicited facsimile advertisements; required the sender of a facsimile advertisement to provide specified notice and contact information on the facsimile that allows recipients to \"opt-out\" of any future facsimile transmissions from the sender; and specified the circumstances under which a request to \"opt-out\" complied with the JFPA. Also, the rules required that small businesses and nonprofits adhere to the rules and clarified the term \"unsolicited advertisement.\" The FCC did not address whether there should be a time limit on the duration of an EBR. The rules in their entirety became effective on August 1, 2006. On April 5, 2006, in accordance with the JFPA, the GAO submitted a report to Congress on the FCC's enforcement of the junk fax law. On January 4, 2007, in accordance with the JFPA, the FCC released its first annual report on the enforcement of its junk fax rules.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe BSA is \"the primary U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) law\" regulating financial institutions. Among other things, the Act and related regulations impose certain reporting and recordkeeping requirements and require certain institutions to establish AML programs that meet specified minimum standards. The BSA and related regulations provide for civil and criminal penalties for violations of their provisions, as well as the forfeiture of assets involved in a violation. The level of BSA penalties varies based on the type of entity charged with a violation, the type of violation, and the defendant's level of intent. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau within the Department of the Treasury primarily charged with administering the BSA, has enforcement authority to bring administrative actions for failure to meet BSA requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the National Credit Union Administration also have authority to enforce the BSA's requirements against the institutions they regulate. Moreover, the Department of Justice (DOJ) regularly brings criminal charges for BSA violations. Commentators have noted an increase in the frequency with which BSA enforcement actions have involved an assessment by federal regulators of monetary penalties, and an increase in the size of those penalties. According to a June 2016 study conducted by National Economic Research Associates, Inc. (NERA), nearly 90% of BSA/AML enforcement actions from 2012 through 2015 involved an assessment of money penalties, compared to less than half of such enforcement actions from 2002 through 2011. NERA also observed that BSA/AML penalties \"have grown substantially in both absolute terms and as a proportion of firm capital.\" Specifically, NERA found that more than 80% of the total money penalties imposed for BSA/AML violations since 2002 have been levied after 2012. Moreover, according to that same report, since October 2009, nearly one-third of BSA/AML penalties have exceeded 10% of a defendant institution's capital. By contrast, no penalty imposed before 2007 exceeded 9% of a defendant institution's capital. Two recent BSA/AML enforcement actions stand out for their size. In 2012, HSBC Holdings plc and HSBC Bank USA N.A. (together, HSBC) were assessed a $665 million civil money penalty, forfeited roughly $1.2 billion, and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) based on, among other things, their failure to maintain an effective AML program and conduct appropriate due diligence on foreign correspondent account holders. The HSBC enforcement action was pursued concurrently by the DOJ, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the Department of the Treasury. Pursuant to the DPA, HSBC admitted responsibility for violating the BSA and associated regulations from 2006 to 2010. Specifically, HSBC admitted that during the relevant time period, it \"ignored the money laundering risks associated with doing business with certain Mexican customers and failed to implement a BSA/AML program that was adequate to monitor suspicious transactions from Mexico.\" According to the DPA, as a result of HSBC's failures, at least $881 million in drug trafficking proceeds were laundered through HSBC Bank USA without being detected. In a series of other BSA enforcement actions, a number of federal regulators assessed large penalties against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan) in January 2014 for its role in the Bernard L. Madoff Ponzi scheme. JPMorgan entered into a DPA with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York concerning Madoff-related BSA violations. Pursuant to the DPA, JPMorgan admitted that it violated the BSA by failing to maintain an effective AML compliance program and failing to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) concerning transactions related to the Madoff scheme. JPMorgan further agreed to forfeit $1.7 billion to compensate victims of the Madoff fraud—the largest-ever penalty for a BSA violation. Separately, the OCC and FinCEN assessed civil money penalties of $350 million and $461 million, respectively, against JPMorgan for its Madoff-related BSA violations. A second recent trend in BSA/AML enforcement is an increased emphasis by regulators on the acceptance of responsibility by institutions charged with BSA violations. In 2013, FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery indicated that FinCEN had changed its approach of generally allowing financial institutions charged with BSA violations to enter into settlements \"without admitting or denying\" the facts alleged in a penalty assessment. Shasky Calvery noted that in FinCEN's most recent enforcement actions, defendant institutions had been required to stipulate to a statement of facts, reflecting the agency's new position that \"[a]cceptance of responsibility and acknowledgment of the facts is a critical component of corporate responsibility.\" Two years later, FinCEN's Director of Enforcement confirmed the agency's changed approach when she indicated that FinCEN operates under a \"presumption\" that \"a settlement of an enforcement action will include an admission to the facts, as well as the violation of law.\" Along these lines, NERA's 2016 study found that four of the six largest BSA/AML violations charged between 2010 and 2015 \"required the [defendant] financial institution to admit the accuracy of government claims and accept responsibility for the actions of its officers, agents, and employees who violated BSA/AML regulations.\" Finally, commentators have noted an increased risk of individual liability for BSA violations. In December 2014, FinCEN assessed a $1 million civil money penalty against Thomas Haider, the former Chief Compliance Officer of MoneyGram International for willful violations of the BSA's program requirements and failure to timely file SARs concerning fraudulent telemarketing operations and other schemes. FinCEN's enforcement action led to litigation over the application of the BSA to individuals. In January 2016, a federal district court held in U.S. Department of Treasury v. Haider that individuals can be liable for violations of the BSA's AML program requirements. In that case, Haider argued that individuals cannot be liable for violations of the BSA's program requirements because the relevant BSA provision provides that \"financial institution[s] shall establish anti-money laundering programs,\" in contrast to the BSA's provision requiring the filing of SARs, which provides that \"any financial institution, and any director, officer, employee, or agent of any financial institution , [may be required] to report suspicious transactions relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation.\" The court rejected this argument, reasoning that because the BSA's general civil penalty provision authorizes the imposition of money penalties against, among other individuals, \"officer[s]\" of financial institutions, Haider could be held liable for violations of the BSA's AML program requirements. Regulators have recently pursued a number of other BSA enforcement actions against individual compliance officers. This increased emphasis on individual prosecutions is broadly consistent with the approach outlined by the DOJ in the September 2015 \"Yates Memo,\" which emphasized the importance of individual accountability for corporate wrongdoing. Current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has indicated that while he \"generally agree[s] with the critique that motivated\" the Yates Memo, the memo is currently under review. Accordingly, it remains to be seen whether the DOJ under President Trump will maintain the previous Administration's emphasis on individual responsibility in white-collar enforcement actions and prosecutions.", "completion": "response:\nThis report provides an overview of recent trends in the enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the principal U.S. anti-money laundering law regulating financial institutions. The report begins by providing general background information on BSA penalties and enforcement. The report concludes by discussing three recent trends that commentators have observed in BSA enforcement: (1) an increase in the frequency with which BSA enforcement actions involve an assessment of money penalties, and an increase in the size of those penalties, (2) an increased emphasis by regulators on the acceptance of responsibility by institutions entering into settlement agreements for BSA violations, and (3) an increased risk of individual liability for BSA violations."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOn December 1, 2008, the National Bureau of Economic Research confirmed what many had suspected for some time – that the economy was in a recession. They announced that the economy had reached a cyclical peak, and that a recession had begun in December 2007. The term \"recession\" may often be used loosely to describe an economy that is slowing down or characterized by weakness in at least one major sector like the housing market. When economists use the term, however, they try to do so consistently. Recessions typically have common characteristics and so economists try to identify the beginning and ending dates of recessions in order to further their overall understanding of the economy. A recession is one of several discrete phases in the overall business cycle. The beginning of a recession is known as a business cycle \"peak,\" and the end of a recession is referred to as a business cycle \"trough.\" In 1946, Arthur Burns and Wesley Mitchell published a study of business cycles and offered a definition intended as a guide for further study: Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle. This definition requires both expansions and recessions to be apparent in many economic activities at about the same time, which would seem to exclude an economy exhibiting weakness in a single market. More recently, economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), issued a memo with a slightly more precise definition: A recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. A recession begins just after the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends as the economy reaches its trough. Between trough and peak, the economy is in an expansion. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief and they have been rare in recent decades. This is the generally accepted view among economists of what constitutes an economic recession. There is also a commonly cited \"rule of thumb\" that is referred to in the press. That rule is that a recession is two consecutive quarterly declines in real gross domestic product (GDP). But this rule does not always apply. For example, there was a recession beginning in March 2001 and ending in November 2001 that was not characterized by two successive quarterly declines in real GDP. In any case, an important distinction is that a recession is a period of declining output and not just a period of slower economic growth. It is possible for GDP growth to be positive yet so slow that the unemployment rate rises. This is sometimes referred to as a \"growth recession.\" Among economists, the NBER is the generally accepted arbiter of business cycle turning points. The NBER is a private nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that was founded in 1920. In the beginning its focus was on the macroeconomy, business cycles, and long-term growth, but now it seeks to promote research on a wide variety of topics. For many years, the NBER itself determined the dates of swings in the business cycle. In 1978, however, a separate business cycle dating committee was formed. The members of the committee are appointed by the president of the NBER, and they are now responsible for determining the dates of the beginnings and ends of recessions. The current members of this committee are Robert Hall, Chair – Director of NBER's Program of Research on Economic Fluctuations and Growth, and Professor at Stanford University; Martin Feldstein – President Emeritus of NBER, and Professor at Harvard University; Jeffrey Frankel – Director of NBER's Program in International Finance and Macroeconomics, and Professor at Harvard University; Robert J.

One important indicator of economic conditions is growth in real gross domestic product (GDP). GDP statistics are compiled each quarter, and thus there is a time lag between the first month that is reflected in the data and the release of the data. For example, the first release of data for the first calendar quarter of a given year does not occur until late April. The data from that release is subject to revision in each of the next two months and may be revised later on as well. It is not inconceivable that a first release of data that showed a decline in real GDP would later be revised to show an increase. Even so, those using the rule of thumb that two successive quarterly declines in real GDP constitutes a recession would have to wait for the release of the second quarter data in August to establish that a recession began at the start of the year. Because of the time lag associated with the release of GDP data, and because business cycle turning points are associated with months rather than quarters, the dating committee relies on a number of monthly economic indicators. Among the more important monthly indicators the committee looks at are personal income, employment, and industrial production. Even in the case of monthly indicators, it may require several months of data to establish a change in trends. When there is a recession, not all of the economic indicators may show a change in trend at the same time. Historically, some indicators, such as housing starts and the stock market, tend to slow or decline in advance of a recession, and some, like the unemployment rate tend to react to changing conditions with a lag. With all statistics it takes some time to compile the data, which means that the statistics are only available after the events they describe. Moreover, because it takes time to discern changes in trends given the usual month-to-month volatility in economic indicators, and because the data are subject to revision, it takes some time before the dating committee can agree that a recession (or an expansion) began at a certain date. Table 1 shows, for recent business cycle peaks and troughs, the date of the turning point and the date when the committee issued a release identifying the date of the turning point. The longest delay between the beginning of a new phase of the business cycle and its announcement was when a recession was found to have ended in March 1991 but was not announced until 21 months had passed. The shortest delay was five months after the expansion ended in January 1980. Of the eight examples shown here, four were not announced until at least a year had elapsed. While all recessions have unique characteristics, they also have many common aspects. Thus they are the object of economic analysis both individually and collectively. Because they are undesirable, economists study them in the hope that they can advise policymakers how to avoid them. To do so, it is important to agree on a chronology, and it may not be an inconvenience to economists that it takes time to establish one. Policymakers, on the other hand, are more concerned with the present and the immediate future. If they hope to avert or mitigate the consequences of recession, they cannot wait for an \"official\" declaration. By then the recession may be history. Although there can be a significant delay between the onset of a recession and the dating committee determination, there is often little doubt that the economy is, or has been, in recession well before the announcement. For policy measures to have mitigating effects, they must be timely. Policymakers may not have the luxury of holding themselves to as strict a definition of recession as economic analysts.", "completion": "response:\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) recently announced that the economy had reached a cyclical peak and that a recession had begun in December 2007. A recession is one of several discrete phases in the overall business cycle. The term may often be used loosely to describe an economy that is slowing down or characterized by weakness in at least one major sector like the housing market. When used by economists, \"recession\" means a significant decline in overall economic activity that lasts more than a few months. NBER business cycle dating committee is the generally recognized arbiter of the dates of the beginnings and ends of recessions. With all statistics it takes some time to compile the data, which means they are only available after the events they describe. Moreover, because it takes time to discern changes in trends given the usual month-to-month volatility in economic indicators, and because the data are subject to revision, it takes some time before the dating committee can agree that a recession began at a certain date. It can be a year or more after the fact that the dating committee announces the date of the beginning of a recession. Just as it took some time for the business cycle dating committee to determine when the recession began, it is likely to be some time after the fact that they determine when the recession has come to an end."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nFederal inspectors general (IGs) have been granted substantial independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse within designated federal departments and agencies. To execute their missions, offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct and publish audits and investigations—among other duties. In some cases, employees within federal offices or inspectors general are vested with law enforcement authority. For the purposes of this report, law enforcement authority is generally defined as having the legal authority to carry a firearm while engaged in official duties; make an arrest without a warrant while engaged in official duties; and seek and execute warrants for arrest, search of premises, or seizure of evidence. According to some OIGs vested with law enforcement authority, these authorities are essential to certain missions of the office. In some cases, for example, OIG law enforcement officers conduct investigations that pose potential safety risks. This report provides a list of the statutes and regulations that are used to vest OIGs with law enforcement authority. It also provides resources that add context to what some OIGs say is a need for law enforcement authority in their offices. Each federal agency, including OIGs, has a unique mission, and, therefore, a unique purpose for its law enforcement authority. In some cases, especially when Congress and the public demonstrate concern about the agency's weapons procurement, an agency may release a public statement detailing its law enforcement authority and its need to acquire weapons or ammunition. For example, in August 2012, the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) OIG posted information on its blog explaining an ammunition purchase that garnered public attention. According to an excerpt from the post, Media reports expressed concerns over the type of ammunition ordered. In fact, this type of ammunition is standard issue for many law enforcement agencies. OIG's special agents use this ammunition during their mandatory quarterly firearms qualifications and other training sessions, to ensure agent and public safety. Additionally, the ammunition our agents use is the same type used at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. In another, more recent example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) OIG received inquiries about OIG solicitations for weapons and body armor. The procurement pertained to the OIG's effort to replace automatic firearms with new semi-automatic firearms. On May 19, 2014, Mr. Paul Feeney, deputy counsel at the OIG, sent the following response to questions about the procurement: The Inspector General Act of 1978 authorized OIG to, among other duties, pursue criminal activity, fraud, and abuses impairing USDA's program and operations. The criminal investigation responsibilities and impact of OIG are quite extensive—from fiscal year 2012 through March 2014, OIG investigations pertaining to USDA operations have obtained over 2,000 indictments, 1,350 convictions, and over $460 million in monetary results. OIG Special Agents are authorized to make arrests, execute warrants, and carry firearms. Regarding the need for weapons' procurements, and for defensive vests, USDA OIG's Investigations division conducts hundreds of criminal investigations each year, some of which involve OIG agents, USDA employees, and/or members of the public facing potentially life threatening situations. OIG special agents regularly conduct undercover operations and surveillance. The types of investigations conducted by OIG special agents include criminal activities such as fraud in farm programs; significant thefts of Government property or funds; bribery and extortion; smuggling; and assaults and threats of violence against USDA employees engaged in their official duties. Generally, there are three ways that an OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority. First, and most commonly, an OIG can be vested with law enforcement explicitly pursuant to Section 6(e)(3) of the IG Act of 1978, as amended (5 U.S.C. (IG Act) Appendix, Section 6(e)(4); hereinafter referred to as the IG Act). Second, an OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority by the Attorney General pursuant to criteria articulated in several provisions of Section 6(e) of the IG Act of 1978. Third, an OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority pursuant to statute outside of the IG Act of 1978, as is the case with six federal entities described below. As shown in Table 1 , the IG Act provides direct law enforcement authority to 25 federal entities explicitly named in Section 6(e)(3) of the act. As noted earlier, pursuant to Section 6 of the IG Act, the Attorney General is authorized to delegate law enforcement authority when 1. an OIG \"is significantly hampered in the performance of responsibilities ... as a result of the lack of such powers\"; 2. \"assistance from other law enforcement agencies is insufficient to meet the need for such powers\"; and 3. \"adequate internal safeguards and management procedures exist to ensure proper exercise of such powers\" (5 U.S.C. (IG Act) Appendix, Section 6(e)(2)). The Attorney General has vested the OIGs within the 10 agencies listed below with law enforcement authority. The National Archives and Records Administration Amtrak The Peace Corps The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The Corporation for National and Community Service The Export-Import Bank of the United States The National Science Foundation The Federal Housing Finance Agency The Securities and Exchange Commission Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. The IG Act authorizes the Attorney General to promulgate guidelines \"that govern the use of law enforcement powers\" for these OIGs. On December 8, 2003, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft promulgated such guidelines, providing OIGs further detail on their law enforcement authorities' scope and limitations. Within these guidelines, Mr. Ashcroft wrote that employees within the OIGs who qualify for law enforcement authority are required to complete various training, including the Basic Criminal Investigator Training Program (or equivalent) and initial and \"refresher firearms training and qualification.\" OIGs are also required to heed the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) deadly force policy. According to Mr. Ashcroft's guidelines, OIGs vested with law enforcement authority through the IG Act must provide \"periodic refresher\" training in trial processes; federal criminal and civil legal updates; interviewing techniques and policy; law of arrest, search, and seizure; and physical conditioning and defensive tactics. Additionally, the OIGs are responsible for following other DOJ law enforcement related policies and guidelines, must consult with DOJ before using electronic surveillance, and must receive other approval before beginning an undercover investigation. As shown in Table 2 , five additional OIGs are provided law enforcement authority through laws outside of the IG Act. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains a Census on Federal Law Enforcement Officers , which includes data on the number of federal employees who are authorized to carry firearms. The most recent report available states that 33 OIGs had a total of 3,501 agents who were authorized to carry firearms in September 2008. Additionally, the report states that no law enforcement officers within an OIG were assaulted or injured in 2008.", "completion": "response:\nFederal inspectors general (IGs) have been granted substantial independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse within designated federal departments and agencies. To execute their missions, offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct and publish audits and investigations—among other duties. Established by public law as permanent, nonpartisan, and independent offices, OIGs exist in more than 70 federal agencies, including all departments and larger agencies, along with numerous boards and commissions and other entities. Many OIGs have been vested with law enforcement authority to assist their investigations. This report provides background on federal offices of inspectors general and their law enforcement authorities in investigations. In this report, law enforcement authority is generally defined as having the legal authority to carry a firearm while engaged in official duties; make an arrest without a warrant while engaged in official duties; and seek and execute warrants for arrest, search of premises, or seizure of evidence. This report identifies the laws and regulations that vest certain OIGs with law enforcement authority, which permits the use of guns and ammunition. This report also describes some of the requirements and expectations of OIGs that have law enforcement authority, and includes some reasons that OIGs have expressed a need for law enforcement authority."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nSocial Security is financed primarily by payroll and self-employment taxes, as well as by a portion of the proceeds from the income taxation of Social Security benefits. The revenues are deposited in the U.S. Treasury. Social Security benefits and administrative expenses are also paid from the U.S. Treasury. By law, if Social Security revenues exceed expenditures, the \"surplus\" is credited to the Social Security trust funds in the form of U.S. government securities. The money itself, however, is used to pay for whatever other expenses the government may have at the time. There is no separate pool of money set aside for Social Security purposes. That is not to say that the trust funds are ephemeral—as long as the trust funds show a positive balance, they represent the authority and an obligation for the U.S. Treasury to issue benefit payments during periods when the program's expenditures exceed revenues. At the end of calendar year 2013, the trust funds were credited with holdings of $2.8 trillion. Section 201 of the Social Security Act provides the following guidelines for trust fund investment. 1. Funds not immediately in demand for benefits or administrative expenses are to be invested in interest-bearing obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. 2. Obligations are to be purchased at issue at the issue price or at the market price for outstanding obligations. 3. The Managing Trustee of the Social Security trust funds (the Secretary of the Treasury) is required to invest in special \"nonmarketable\" federal public-debt obligations—special issues to the trust funds that are not available to the general public—except where he or she determines that the purchase of marketable federal securities is \"in the public interest.\" 4. Special issues shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the trust funds and will pay a rate of interest, calculated at the time of issue, equal to the average market yield on all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States that are not due or callable (redeemable) for at least four years. 5. Marketable federal securities purchased by the trust funds may be sold at the market price and special issue obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest (without penalty for redemption before maturity). The Treasury Department has determined that the purchase of marketable federal securities (i.e., public issues) would be in the public interest only when it might serve to stabilize the market for Treasury issues. Because an \"unstable market\" would be characterized by falling bond prices, purchases of marketable federal securities at these times would appear to be advantageous for the trust funds. In practice, however, open market purchases have been rare. Although the trust funds have held public issues in the past, the trust funds currently hold special issues only. The interest earned on these holdings is credited to the trust funds semiannually (on June 30 and December 31); it is done by issuing additional federal securities to the trust funds. In calendar year 2013, net interest totaled $102.8 billion, representing 12% of total trust fund income. The effective annual rate of interest earned on all obligations held by the trust funds in calendar year 2013 was 3.8%. The interest rate earned on special issues purchased by the trust funds in August 2014 is 2.375%. The maturity dates of newly issued special issues are set by a standardized procedure. Revenues are invested immediately in short-term issues called certificates of indebtedness, which mature on the next June 30. On June 30 of each year, certificates of indebtedness that have not been redeemed are reinvested in longer-term special issue bonds. Generally, the maturities of these bonds range from 1 to 15 years; the goal is to have about one-fifteenth of them mature each year, depending on the needs of the trust funds. While some critics have questioned whether the current investment policy has constrained the earnings of the trust funds, over the years various advisory councils, congressional committees, and other groups generally have endorsed it. It has been justified as a way to ensure safety of principal and stability of interest, and as a way to avoid intrusion into private markets. It also has been regarded as a way to avoid the political influences that would be inherent in investing outside the U.S. government. Generally, the goal espoused has been to place the trust funds in the same position as any long-term investor seeking a safe rate of return by investing in U.S. securities, and neither advantage nor disadvantage the trust funds relative to these investors or other parts of the government. For most of the program's history, interest income to the trust funds has not been a major factor in program financing. In recent years, however, the increasing role of interest income, as well as interest by some policy makers in preventing any surplus Social Security tax revenues from being used for other government spending purposes, have focused attention on alternative investment practices. For example, there have been proposals to replace the special issues held by the trust funds with marketable federal securities, as well as proposals to allow any surplus Social Security tax revenues or a portion of trust fund reserves to be invested in assets other than U.S. government obligations, including equities.", "completion": "response:\nThe Social Security Act has always required surplus Social Security revenues (revenues in excess of program expenditures) to be invested in U.S. government securities (or U.S. government-backed securities). In recent years, attention has been focused on alternative investment practices in an effort to increase the interest earnings of the trust funds, among other goals. This report describes Social Security trust fund investment practices under current law."}

Over the past decade U.S. imports have almost doubled, reaching $2.7 trillion in 2011. During the same period, the United States entered into free trade agreements that liberalize trade with 14 partner countries. Further trade liberalization is being pursued, including a Transpacific Partnership among 11 nations in the Asia-Pacific region. Although trade expansion can enhance the economic welfare of all trade partners, many firms and workers experience difficulties adjusting to import competition. Congress has responded to concerns about these difficulties with trade adjustment assistance programs. Established in 1962, the TAA for Firms program provides technical assistance to help trade-impacted, economically distressed firms make adjustments that may enable them to remain competitive in the global economy. In fiscal years 2009 through 2012, EDA received $15.8 million annually for the TAA for Firms program. EDA uses its appropriation for the TAA for Firms program to fund 11 TAA Centers (center), which provide assistance to U.S. manufacturing, production, and service firms in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Congress amended the TAA for Firms program under that part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 known as the Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act (TGAAA) of 2009 and mandated that we review the operation and effectiveness of these amendments. This testimony is based on our September 2012 report that examined (1) the results of the legislative changes on program operations and participation, (2) the performance measures and data that EDA uses to evaluate the program and what these tell us about the program's effectiveness, and (3) how program funding is allocated and spent. First, we found that the four changes mandated by the 2009 legislation contributed to improvements in program operations and increased participation: (1) Creation of director and other full-time positions: The creation of a director and other full-time positions for the program resulted in reduced firm certification processing times for petitions. (2) New annual reporting on performance measures: EDA has submitted three annual reports to Congress on these performance measures as a result of the legislation. (3) Inclusion of service sector firms: According to our analysis of EDA data, the inclusion of service sector firms allowed EDA to certify 26 firms not previously eligible for assistance from fiscal years 2009 through 2011. (4) Expansion of the \"look-back\" period from 12 months to 12, 24, or 36 months: Our analysis of EDA data shows that 32 additional firms participated in the program from fiscal years 2009 through 2011 based on the expansion of the look-back period from 12 months to 12, 24, or 36 months. Prior to the legislative changes, firms were only allowed to compare sales and production data in the most recent 12 months to data from the immediately preceding 12-month period. Second, we found that EDA's performance measures and data collection for the TAA for Firms program provide limited information about the program's outcomes, although our economic analysis found a statistically significant association between participation in the program and an increase in firm sales. EDA collects data to report on 16 measures to gauge the program's performance, such as the number of firms that inquired about the program and the number of petitions filed, but most of these measures do not assess program outcomes. EDA is exploring better ways to assess the effect of their efforts on firms. Third, in terms of how funds are allocated and spent, we identified key weakness pertaining to EDA's funding formula. EDA has allocated funding to the 11 TAA Centers using a funding allocation formula that comprises a set of weighted factors; however, the formula does not take into account the potential number of firms in need of the program and differences in costs across the centers. According to a key standard--beneficiary equity--a funding allocation formula should distribute funds according to the needs of respective populations and should take into account the costs of providing program services, so that each service area can provide the same level of services to firms in need."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the primary source of federal aid to elementary and secondary education. Title I-A is the largest program in the ESEA, funded at $15.5 billion for FY2017. The program is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending elementary and secondary schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) determines Title I-A grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on four separate funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). The ESEA was comprehensively reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95 ) on December 10, 2015. The ESSA made few changes to the Title I-A formulas. These changes took effect in FY2017. This report provides FY2017 state grant amounts under each of the four formulas used to determine Title I-A grants. For a general overview of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44164, ESEA Title I-A Formulas: In Brief . For a more detailed discussion of the Title I-A formulas, see CRS Report R44461, Allocation of Funds Under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act . Under Title I-A, funds are allocated to LEAs via state educational agencies (SEAs) using the four Title I-A formulas. Annual appropriations bills specify portions of each year's Title I-A appropriation to be allocated to LEAs and states under each of the formulas. In FY2017, about 42% of Title I-A appropriations were allocated through the Basic Grants formula, 9% through the Concentration Grants formula, and 25% each through the Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas. Once funds reach LEAs, the amounts allocated under the four formulas are combined and used jointly. For each formula, a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a formula child count , consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children in poor families, by an expenditure factor based on state average per-pupil expenditures for public elementary and secondary education. In some formulas, additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor. These maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula, taking into account a variety of state and LEA minimum grant provisions. In general, LEAs must have a minimum number of formula children and/or a minimum formula child rate to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific Title I-A formula. Some LEAs may qualify for a grant under only one formula, while other LEAs may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas. Under three of the formulas—Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants—funds are initially calculated at the LEA level. State grants are the total of allocations for all LEAs in the state, adjusted for state minimum grant provisions. Under EFIG, grants are first calculated for each state overall and then are subsequently suballocated to LEAs within the state using a different formula. FY2017 grants included in this report were calculated by ED. The percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas was calculated by CRS for each state by dividing the total grant received by the total amount allocated under each respective formula. Table 1 provides each state's grant amount and percentage share of funds allocated under each of the Title I-A formulas for FY2017. Total Title I-A grants, calculated by summing the state level grant for each of the four formulas, are also shown in Table 1 . Overall, California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount ($1.8 billion) and, as a result, the largest percentage share (12.00%) of Title I-A grants. Vermont received the smallest total Title I-A grant amount ($35.3 million) and, as a result, the smallest percentage share (0.23%) of Title I-A grants. In general, grant amounts for states vary among formulas due to the different allocation amounts for the formulas. For example, the Basic Grant formula receives a greater share of overall Title I-A appropriations than the Concentration Grant formula, so states generally receive higher grant amounts under the Basic Grant formula than under the Concentration Grant formula. Among states, Title I-A grant amounts and the percentage shares of funds vary due to the different characteristics of each state. For example, Texas has a much larger population of children included in the formula calculations than North Carolina and, therefore, receives a higher grant amount and larger share of Title I-A funds. Within a state, the percentage share of funds allocated may vary by formula, as certain formulas are more favorable to certain types of states (e.g., EFIG is generally more favorable to states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their LEAs). If a state's share of a given Title I-A formula exceeds its share of overall Title I-A funds, this is generally an indication that this particular formula is more favorable to the state than formulas for which the state's share of funds is below its overall share of Title I-A funds. For example, Florida and New York received a substantially higher percentage share of Targeted Grants than of overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Targeted Grant formula is more favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be. At the same time, both states received a smaller percentage share of Basic Grants than of overall Title I-A funds, indicating that the Basic Grant formula is less favorable to them than other Title I-A formulas may be. In the four states (North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming) that receive a minimum grant under all four formulas, the shares received under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas are greater than under the Basic Grant or Concentration Grant formulas, due to higher state minimums under these formulas. If a state received the minimum grant under a given Title I-A formula, the grant amount is denoted with an asterisk (*) in Table 1 .", "completion": "response:\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95), is the primary source of federal aid to K-12 education.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nQualifications for, and the amount of, the earned income tax credit (EITC) depend on the amount of earned income, adjusted gross income (AGI), and whether the tax filer has a qualified child. For the EITC, a qualified child is determined by the definition of a qualified child for the personal exemption. In general, for the personal exemption for a dependent, an individual is either a qualifying relative or a qualifying child. A qualified child for the EITC must meet the following three criteria for the personal exemption: relationship—the child must be a son, daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, or descendent of such a relative; a brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or descendent of such a relative; an adopted child; or a foster child placed with the taxpayer; residence—the child must live with the tax filer for more than half the year; and age—the child must be under the age of 19 (or age 24, if a full-time student) or be permanently and totally disabled. For the EITC, a qualified child cannot be married and must have a principal place of abode (where the child lives with the tax filer) within the United States (an exception exists for military personnel stationed overseas). A custodial parent may have a qualified child for the EITC without using other tax benefits associated with the child (such as the personal exemption) because the EITC disregards a waiver of the personal exemption and the child tax credit to a noncustodial parent. In general, the EITC amount increases with earnings up to a point (the maximum earned income amount), then remains unchanged (at the maximum credit) for a certain bracket of income, and then, beginning at the phase-out income level, gradually decreases to zero as earnings continue to increase. A family will be disqualified from receiving the earned income credit if investment income exceeds a specified level. The maximum earned income amount, the phase-out income level, and the disqualifying investment income amount are indexed for inflation. For married couples filing a joint tax return, in tax years 2002 through 2004, the phase-out level was $1,000 higher than for other filers. In tax years 2005 through 2007, the phase-out level was $2,000 higher, and beginning in tax year 2008, the phase-out level was $3,000 higher. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ) increased this differential to $5,000 for tax year 2009, and adjusted for inflation in 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 ) extended the ARRA provisions for marriage penalty relief through tax year 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ) extends the ARRA provisions for five years (through tax year 2017). The phase-out level for married couples filing a joint tax return was $5,210 higher than for other tax filers in tax year 2012, and will be $5,340 higher than for other tax filers in tax year 2013. To make it easier for tax filers to determine the correct amount of the credit, a table for the earned income credit is included in the income tax booklet based on $50 increments of income. Table 1 shows the parameters for the EITC (credit rates, phase-out rates, maximum earned income amount, maximum credit, phase-out income level, and disqualifying investment income level) for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012. As shown in Table 1 , between tax years 2011 and 2013, there are increases in the maximum earned income, maximum credit, and phase-out income levels associated with indexing for inflation. The effect of the indexing is that the largest percentage increases in EITC between 2011 and 2013 will be for higher-income EITC-eligible tax filers. A limited number of taxpayers not eligible for the EITC in tax year 2011 will, because of indexing, be eligible for a small EITC in tax years 2012 and 2013. P.L. 111-5 (ARRA) created a new credit category, for families with three or more children, for tax years 2009 and 2010 only. For families with three or more children, the credit rate in tax years 2009 and 2010 was 45%. The ARRA also increased the phase-in amount for married couples filing joint tax returns so that it was $5,000 higher than for unmarried taxpayers in tax year 2009. In tax year 2010, the differential was adjusted for inflation. P.L. 111-226 , the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act, eliminated the option to receive the credit during the tax year (the Advance Earned Income Credit), for tax years beginning after December 31, 2010. P.L. 111-312 extended the ARRA provisions for marriage penalty relief and the category for three or more children through tax year 2012. P.L. 111-312 also extended through tax year 2012, the changes to the credit made by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16 ) that were scheduled to expire after December 31, 2010. The EGTRRA changes that were extended through tax year 2012 include (1) changing the definition of earned income for the EITC so that it does not include nontaxable employee compensation; (2) eliminating the reduction in the EITC for the alternative minimum tax; (3) simplifying the calculation of the credit through use of AGI rather than modified adjusted gross income; and (4) providing marriage penalty relief through a higher phase-out income level for taxpayers filing married joint tax returns. P.L. 112-240 (ATRA) made the EGTRRA changes permanent and extended the ARRA provisions for families with three or more children and marriage penalty relief for five years (through tax year 2017).", "completion": "response:\nThe earned income tax credit (EITC), established in the tax code in 1975, provides cash assistance to lower income working parents and individuals through the tax system. The EITC will be higher in 2012 and 2013 than it was in 2011. An increase in the size of the EITC will occur because the maximum amount of earned income used to calculate the credit and the phase-out income level are indexed for inflation. The increases reflect the inflation adjustment. For tax year 2012, the maximum EITC for tax filers without children was $475, and it will increase to $487 in 2013. For families with one child, the maximum credit was $3,169 in tax year 2012, and it will increase to $3,250 in 2013. For families with two children, in tax year 2012 the maximum was $5,236, and it will increase to $5,372 in 2013. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) created a new credit category, for families with three or more children for tax years 2009 and 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312) extended the new category for three or more children to tax years 2011 and 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) extended the ARRA provisions for families with three or more children and marriage penalty relief for five years (through tax year 2017). For families with three or more children, the maximum credit was $5,751 in tax year 2011, $5,891 in tax year 2012, and will be $6,044 in tax year 2013. Beginning in tax year 2008, the phase-out level for married couples filing a joint tax return was $3,000 higher than the level for other filers. ARRA increased the $3,000 differential for married couples to $5,000 for tax year 2009, and inflation adjusted the amount for tax year 2010. P.L. 111-312 extended the higher phase-out level to tax years 2011 and 2012. In tax year 2011, the phase-out level for married couples was $5,080 higher than for unmarried taxpayers, $5,210 higher in tax year 2012, and in tax year 2013, it will be $5,340 higher than for unmarried taxpayers.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThis report provides summary data on the number of Senators and Members of the House who first entered Congress between the 64 th Congress (1915-1917) and the 114 th Congress (2015-2016). Since the convening of the 64 th Congress, 4,201 individuals have entered the House of Representatives for their first, or \"freshman,\" terms as a Representative. An additional 28 have begun service as a Delegate or Resident Commissioner. During th e same period, 844 individuals began their first terms in the Senate. First-term membership is divided into two broad categories in each chamber: Members chosen prior to the convening of a Congress, and those chosen after a Congress convenes. The \"pre-convening\" category includes Members who were elected in the general election, and in any special elections held prior to the convening of a Congress. The 64 th Congress was chosen as the starting point for data collection because it was the first Congress for which Senators were chosen by direct popular election. This provides a single date upon which most Members in both chambers are chosen to serve prior to the convening of a Congress. In the Senate, the pre-convening category also includes any Senators who were appointed to the Senate prior to the convening of a new Congress. The \"post-convening\" category includes Members who joined either chamber after the convening of a Congress. Means by which seats may be filled by a post-convening Member in either chamber include special elections held after a Congress convenes or electoral challenges that result in a new Member being seated. In the Senate, a first-term Member may also join the chamber through appointment or special election. Members whose congressional service in one chamber is not consecutive are counted as first-term Members in the first instance of their service as a Member, if that term occurred between the 64 th and 114 th Congresses. For example, a Representative who served in the 87 th Congress (1961-1962), and 89 th Congress (1965-1966), but not the 88 th Congress (1963-1964), would be counted as a first-term Representative only for the 87 th Congress. Members with service in the House and Senate are listed in each capacity in which they served a first term, if those terms occurred between the 64 th and 114 th Congresses. The resulting data, combining pre-convening and post-convening first-term Members, provide a count of all Members who served a first term in the House or Senate. Data on pre-convening first-term Members provide partial insight into the extent of membership turnover in the House and Senate since 1915, and are discussed in greater detail below. Post-convening first-term Member data do not reveal clear patterns within individual Congresses, or over time. This is due in part to the wide range of reasons that a seat in the House and Senate may become vacant in the course of a Congress, and the circumstances under which it may be filled. Data describing the number and partisan breakdown of first-term membership in the Senate are provided in the \" Data Tables \" section in Table 6 . Data describing first-term Representatives are available in Table 7 . Table 8 in the same section provides information for Members of the House serving as a Delegate or Resident Commissioner. Data on pre-convening first-term Members provide insight into the extent of membership turnover in the House and Senate. Table 5 in the \" Data Tables \" section summarizes the number of pre-convening Members entering the House and Senate at the beginning of a new Congress, and as a percentage of the seats in each chamber. These data identify most of the turnover in each chamber, but they may not identify all of the changes in every Congress, since they only reflect the number of Members who served their first term in the chamber. Some Members who had prior service that is not consecutive may have been reelected to the House, or reelected or appointed to the Senate. In those circumstances, the data in Table 5 may understate the extent of change in some Congresses. Since the 64 th Congress, the average turnover in the House with each election has been 72 seats, or 16.57%. The election with the greatest change occurred in 1932, resulting in a turnover of 158 seats, or 36.32% of the Representatives between the 72 nd Congress (1931-1933) and the 73 rd Congress (1933-1934). The smallest pre-convening turnover among Representatives in the House occurred in the 101 st Congress (1989-1990), with a change in 30 seats, or 6.90%. Figure 1 provides a graphic representation of the percentage change in House membership between the 64 th Congress and the 114 th Congress. The data suggest that while there is no consistent pattern of change from Congress to Congress, the overall number of new, pre-convening, first-term Representatives has declined. This appears to be consistent with some academic findings that argue that the durations of Members' careers have been increasing in the past century. Table 1 provides data for the House on the number of seats and percentage change of the five Congresses that saw the greatest change in pre-convening Representatives between the 64 th and 114 th Congresses. With one exception, the 103 rd Congress (1993-1994), these changes occurred in Congresses convening prior to the 74 th Congress (1935-1936). Table 2 provides data on the number of seats and percentage change of the six Congresses that saw the least change between the 64 th and 114 th Congresses. The smallest pre-convening turnover among Representatives in the House occurred in the 101 st Congress (1989-1990), with a change in 30 seats, or 6.90%. All of the smallest changes occurred after the 89 th Congress (1965-1966). The distribution of greater changes occurring earlier in the period between the 64 th -114 th Congresses, and smaller changes happening in the later period may also support contentions regarding the duration of Representatives' careers. Data describing the number and partisan distribution of first-term Representatives are provided in Table 7 . Table 8 provides similar information for Members of the House serving as a Delegate or Resident Commissioner. As shown in Table 5 , in the \" Data Tables \" section, since the 64 th Congress, the average number of pre-convening first-term Senators each Congress has been 10. Table 6 shows that the 79 th Congress (1945-1946) produced the greatest change in membership with 33 new Senators, 34.38%, taking seats in the chamber in the course of the Congress. Figure 2 provides a graphic representation of the percentage change in first-term Senate membership between the 64 th Congress and the 114 th Congress. The data suggest that while there is no consistent pattern of change from Congress to Congress, the overall number of pre-convening, first-term Senators has declined since the 64 th Congress. Changes in Member career patterns in the Senate may explain some of the change. Table 3 provides data on the number of Senate seats and percentage change of the five Congresses that saw greatest change between the 64 th and 114 th Congresses. All of those Congresses occurred before the 87 th Congress (1961-1962). The smallest turnover of pre-convening Senators occurred in the 102 nd Congress (1991-1992), with a change of three seats. In the 73 rd Congress (1932-1933), a 15-seat change amounted to a percentage change of 15.63%, since the Senate had 96 seats. Table 4 provides data on the number of seats and percentage change of the seven Congresses that saw the least change between the 64 th and 114 th Congresses. Smaller changes appear to be more evenly distributed through the latter half of the Congresses observed. This may be explained in part by electoral patterns. While the entire House stands for election every two years, only one-third of the seats in the Senate are subject to election in the same period; barring change in membership for other reasons, this assures that two-thirds of Senate membership will remain unchanged. Data describing the first-term membership of the Senate are provided in Table 6 .", "completion": "response:\nThis report provides summary data on the number of Senators and Members of the House of Representatives who first entered Congress between the 64th Congress (1915-1917) and the 114th Congress (2015-2016).

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nChanging economic, social, and political conditions at home and abroad have led some analysts to question whether the United States will remain globally competitive in the coming decades. The possibility that the United States has lost or could lose its historical advantages in scientific and technological advancement—and the prosperity and security attributed to that advancement—has become a primary rationale for a portfolio of otherwise disparate federal programs, policies, and activities. Sometimes identified as \"innovation\" or \"competitiveness\" policy, these programs, policies, and activities address research and development, education, workforce development, tax, patent, immigration, economic development, telecommunications, or other policy issues perceived as critical to the U.S. scientific and technological enterprise. The 2007 America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ) is an example of this type of policymaking. Designed to \"invest in innovation through research and development, and to improve the competitiveness of the United States,\" the law authorized $32.7 billion in appropriations between FY2008 and FY2010 for programs and activities in physical sciences and engineering research and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Congress reauthorized certain provisions of P.L. 110-69 —including funding for physical sciences and engineering research and STEM education—when it passed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ). The 2010 COMPETES Act authorized $45.5 billion in appropriations between FY2011 and FY2013. Given the pivotal role that funding levels played in the design, implementation, and congressional debate about the COMPETES Acts, policymakers have paid close attention to trends in these accounts. This report, which was written to aid Congress in tracking these trends, includes two tables summarizing authorization levels and funding for selected COMPETES-related accounts across both authorization periods (i.e., FY2008 to FY2010 and FY2011 to FY2013).

In response to these and closely related concerns, Congress enacted the 2007 America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69), as well as its successor, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358). These acts were broadly designed to invest in innovation through research and development and to improve U.S. competitiveness. More specifically, the acts authorized increased funding for certain physical science and engineering research accounts and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education activities. Congressional debate about the COMPETES Acts focuses closely on authorized and appropriated funding levels. To aid this debate, this CRS report tracks accounts and activities authorized by the 2007 and 2010 COMPETES Acts during each act's authorization period. It includes only those accounts and activities for which the acts provide a defined (i.e., specific) appropriations authorization.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nHome and community-based services refer to a range of health and supportive services (delivered in non-institutional settings) that are needed by individuals who lack the capacity for self-care because of a physical, cognitive, or mental disability or chronic condition resulting in functional impairment(s) for extended time periods. Medicaid has covered home- and community-based services (HCBS) since the program's inception in 1965 through various service categories. From the start, Medicaid allowed states to cover a range of home health services and required states to cover those services for individuals who otherwise would require treatment in nursing facilities. Home health services include skilled nursing, aide services, medical equipment and supplies, and, often, therapy. States also are permitted to cover rehabilitation and private duty nursing services. Rehabilitation can include a range of medical or remedial services recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner to reduce the degree of physical or mental disability and restore functioning. Private-duty nursing is skilled nursing care for individuals who require services beyond what is available under Medicaid's home health or personal care benefits. Over time, Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) authorized states to cover other types of HCBS services as optional benefits. States could offer HCBS services, such as personal care and case management , by including these services in their state plans. Personal care and case management services were added as optional Medicaid benefits in 1978 and 1986, respectively. Through personal care, beneficiaries are assisted with activities of daily living (e.g., dressing, bathing, eating), while case management includes services to assist Medicaid beneficiaries in gaining access to needed medical, social, educational, and other services. In addition to the Medicaid state plan benefits, in 1981, Congress authorized HCBS waivers under Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act (SSA). HCBS, 1915(c) waivers, enable states to cover a range of services for beneficiaries who otherwise would require institutional levels of care (i.e., nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate care facility for individuals with mental retardation). Under HCBS-waivers, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is permitted to waive Medicaid's federal \"statewideness\" requirement to allow states to cover HCBS services in limited geographic areas. The Secretary also may waive the requirement that services be comparable in amount, duration, or scope for individuals in particular eligibility categories. HCBS waivers authorize states to limit the number of individuals served and to target certain populations (e.g., individuals with developmental disabilities, brain injuries, or the aged). For HCBS waivers to be approved, states also must meet other requirements, such as a cost-effectiveness test, where average Medicaid expenditures for waiver participants do not exceed costs that would have been incurred if these individuals resided in institutions. All states cover HCBS for certain groups of Medicaid beneficiaries. In 2005, 35 states and the District of Columbia used the Medicaid personal care state plan benefit to provide services for individuals with disabilities. Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have at least one HCBS-waiver for elderly individuals, younger adults with physical disabilities, or individuals with mental retardation or developmental disabilities. States also use HCBS waivers to provide services for other groups, such as individuals with HIV/AIDS or brain injuries. Table 1 summarizes the number of states offering HCBS benefits, the number of beneficiaries receiving services, and total expenditures. Section 6086 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ) authorized a new optional benefit that allows states to cover limited HCBS without waivers. The requirements of this new optional benefit, Section 1915(i) of SSA, differ from other Medicaid state plan benefits (e.g., home health and personal care) and the Section 1915(c) HCBS-waivers. Table 2 compares key features of the new HCBS benefit with existing Medicaid program authorities. Section 1915(i) authorizes states to offer HCBS without a waiver beginning in January 2007. States can define beneficiaries' needs, and do not have to require that beneficiaries meet institutional levels of care to qualify for services. Also under 1915(i), states may amend their Medicaid plans without demonstrating budget neutrality as they do under 1915(c) waivers. Section 1915(i) permits states to offer fewer HCBS services than are permitted under 1915(c) waivers and to restrict eligibility to beneficiaries whose incomes fall below 150% of FPL. States also may offer self-direction under the 1915(i) option and may cap enrollment. CMS is developing regulations to guide states that want to offer HCBS under 1915(i) and plans to issue a notice of proposed rule making in early 2008. CMS also conducted training on the new state plan option for its regional office staff and for states' Medicaid staff as well as drafting a state plan amendment (SPA) preprint. Four states have submitted SPAs to provide HCBS services as permanent Medicaid benefits. Three HCBS-SPAs are under review by CMS. Iowa was the first state to submit a HCBS-SPA and was approved in April 2007 to provide HCBS services to 3,700 seriously mentally ill beneficiaries in the first year and 4,500 beneficiaries by year five. State utilization of the 1915(i) option may lag behind expectations created by the recent rapid growth of HCBS waivers and program cost estimates. Data on states' plans for adopting the 1915(i) HCBS option are limited, but an October 2007 survey of states on their LTC plans indicates that two states planned to submit HCBS-SPAs, while 16 other states and a territory (Guam) were considering the option. The remainder of this section discusses issues that could affect states' utilization of the Section 1915(i) option. Under 1915(c) waivers, states may use higher income standards for determining beneficiaries' eligibility for services than income standards under 1915(i)—up to 300 % of SSI for 1915(c) versus 150% of the federal poverty level (FPL) for 1915(i). The more restrictive income eligibility standards under 1915(i) limits states from \"converting\" beneficiaries in existing 1915(c) waivers to 1915(i)-SPAs, because many states' permit beneficiaries to have higher incomes than 150% of the FPL in 1915(c) waivers. In addition to more restrictive eligibility standards, 1915(i) is limited to covering only services described in Section 1915(c) paragraph 4(B). The 1915(i) SPA option prevents states from adding other services requested by states on a case-by-case basis, as permitted under 1915(c) waivers. Under 1915(c) waivers states have used the \"other services clause\" to address the needs of specific beneficiary groups. For example, HCBS-waivers have been used to expand services to include transportation, apartment deposits, and even home modifications necessary for community living. Under 1915(c) waivers, states may define eligibility based on diseases or conditions, such as brain injury or HIV/AIDS, or geographic area, such as a city or county. Under 1915(i), however, states must create different ways to measure qualification for services that rely on individuals' needs for service. Under HCBS-waivers, Medicaid may use common medical measures, such as diagnoses, but assessing individuals' support needs using activities of daily living can be more difficult to measure for some populations.", "completion": "response:\nSection 6086 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, (DRA, P.L. 109-171), established a optional Medicaid benefit giving states a new method with which to cover home- and community-based (HCBS) services for Medicaid beneficiaries, starting in January 2007. Prior to DRA's enactment, states needed HCBS waivers authorized in Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to cover these services. The HCBS-state plan optional benefit, Section 1915(i), differs from both existing Medicaid state plan benefits and Section 1915(c) waivers. This report outlines requirements of the new 1915(i) benefit and compares key features of this benefit with other Medicaid state plan benefits and 1915(c) waivers. It will be updated periodically."}

The Secretary of the Senate was initially responsible for keeping the minutes and records of the Senate, transmitting messages to the House of Representatives, and purchasing supplies. Today, the Secretary of the Senate's jurisdiction has been expanded beyond the original duties. These additional responsibilities include supervision of the clerks, curators, official recorders of debates, and the parliamentarian; the disbursement of payroll; the education of the Senate pages; and the maintenance of public records. The Secretary also serves as the chief financial officer of the Senate and is the custodian of the Senate seal. In the event that the Secretary dies, resigns, or is disabled, the Assistant Secretary of the Senate acts as Secretary until a new Secretary is elected or the disability has ended. Acting jointly, only the majority and minority leaders and the President pro tempore can certify that the Secretary is unable to perform her duties. The duties and responsibilities of the Secretary of the Senate have developed over time through several sources. These sources include statutes, Senate rules and orders, and custom and precedent. Statutes, rules and orders, and other materials may be found in the United States Code , which is the codification, by subject matter, of the general and permanent laws of the United States; the United States Statutes at Large , which is the collection of all laws and resolutions enacted during each session of Congress; the Senate Manual , which contains the texts of the (1) Standing Rules of the Senate, (2) standing orders of the senate, (3) rules for the Regulation of the Senate Wing of the United States Capitol, and (4) excerpts from laws applicable to the Senate; and through custom and precedent. Many of the duties of the Secretary of the Senate are defined by the Senate Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. As a consequence of its jurisdiction over Senate administrative matters, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration oversees operations of the Secretary of the Senate. The Secretary of the Senate's duties and responsibilities can be divided into three broad categories: financial, administrative, and legislative. The Secretary is the chief financial officer of the Senate. As such, the Secretary is responsible for funds appropriated to the Senate and for managing and supervising the disbursing office, which among its financial duties handles the Senate payroll and related personnel matters. The Secretary also conducts audits of Senate financial activities. Details on expenditures of funds appropriated to the Senate are published semi-annually by the Secretary in the Senate document, Report of the Secretary of the Senate. The Secretary of the Senate is responsible for a number of services within the Senate. These responsibilities include the Senate Stationery Room; the Senate Library; the Conservation and Preservation Office; the Office of Public Records; the Senate Historical Office; the Office of Senate Curator; the Office of Senate Security; the Office of Interparliamentary Services; the Office of Printing and Document Services; the Disbursing Office; the Senate Page Program; and the Senate Gift Shop (including Gift Shop Revolving Fund). Other duties of the Secretary of the Senate include maintenance of the Senate public website; supervision of Senate staff displaced by the death or resignation of a Senator; and supervision of the Senate legal counsel. The Secretary of the Senate manages functions that support the legislative process in the Senate, such as signing legislation after Senate passage. The Secretary also supervises the following staff (listed with their roll in the Senate legislative process): Bill Clerk (records the Senate's official activities and status of legislation); Enrolling Clerk (prepares Senate-passed legislation before it is sent to the President); Executive Clerk (records Senate actions during executive sessions, produces the Executive Calendar, and processes nominations and treaty resolutions received from the President); Journal Clerk (records the Senate's daily legislative proceedings and prepares a history of legislation for the Senate Journal ); Legislative Clerk (reads aloud bills and amendments, the Senate Journal , messages to the Senate; calls the roll and prepares the daily Calendar of Business); Official Reporters of Debates (prepare verbatim reports of Senate floor proceedings for the Congressional Record ); and Parliamentarian (advises Senators and staff on Senate precedents and rules, precedents, and statutes related to Senate proceedings). In addition, the Secretary of the Senate manages the following offices: Daily Digest (preparing the resume of each day's activities of the Senate for the Congressional Record , including committee hearings and meetings, and floor actions); Captioning Services Office (provides captions of Senate proceedings for the hearing-impaired); Continuity of Operations Program (supports the Senate's ability to conduct business and access data at an offsite location, in conjunction with the Senate Sergeant at Arms).

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nBecause of the annual budget and appropriation process in Congress and the current conflicts involving U.S. servicemembers overseas, there is a strong interest in the levels of spending by the federal government for veterans' benefits and services among members of Congress and the public. For this report, veterans' benefits and services include direct spending on veterans (such as disability compensation or health care) and indirect spending (such as administration and construction of facilities). This report provides information on the historical budget authority for veterans' benefits and services for FY1940 through FY2012, and a brief discussion of major changes in budget authority over this period. Budget authority is presented in both current dollars and constant 2011 dollars (i.e., inflation-adjusted). The budget authority for veterans' benefits and services over the FY1940-FY2012 period has generally shown a steady increase. As can be seen in Table 1 and Figure 1 , the FY2012 budget authority in current dollars was more than 20 0 times the FY1940 budget authority, reflecting an average annual growth rate for the period of 7.9%. In constant 2011 dollars, the FY2012 budget authority is 1 4 times the FY1940 budget authority and reflects a 3.8% average annual growth rate over the period. A large number of Americans, 16.1 million, served in the military in World War II (WWII, December 7, 1941, through December 31, 1946), making WWII the largest conflict to date in terms of the number of servicemembers. Because the servicemembers volunteered (or were drafted) for \"the duration,\" a large number of servicemembers were released in a relatively short period of time at the end of the war. Before the end of the war, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act (P.L. 346 of the 78 th Congress), commonly known as the GI Bill, was signed into law in 1944, providing a major change in benefits for veterans. The GI Bill introduced education and training benefits that enabled millions of servicemembers who may have otherwise been unable to attend college or training schools to receive a college education or specific job skills training. In addition, the housing loan guarantee benefits provided by the GI Bill enabled WWII veterans to purchase homes for their families. As shown in Table 1 , the combination of the large number of veterans being released in a relatively short period of time and the change in benefits resulted in the budget authority for veterans increasing from $561.1 million before the war in FY1940 to a peak in the post-war period in FY1947 of almost $8.4 billion. In current dollars, the FY1947 budget authority was 14.9 times the FY1940 pre-war budget authority for veterans. In constant 2011 dollars, the FY1947 budget authority for veterans was $80.7 billion, or 9. 8 times the FY1940 pre-war budget authority for veterans. The Vietnam era (February 28, 1961 through May 7, 1975) was significantly longer than WWII, with a total of 8.7 million Americans who served in the military during the period. Until the end of 1972, a military draft was in place (the last drafted servicemembers began service in 1973), and drafted servicemembers were released through the period at the end of their military obligation. Also, while benefit changes or expansions were made during the period, no new large benefit programs were started during the period (unlike the WWII period). As a result of the regular release of servicemembers from the military over the period and the relatively stable levels of veterans' benefits and services, the large peak in budget authority at the end of WWII was not repeated at the end of the Vietnam era. There was however a smaller peak in budget authority for the FY1975-FY1976 period that reflected an increase in the number of veterans at the end of the Vietnam conflict. While the current dollar budget authority for FY1975 and FY1976 was 2.0 and 2.3 times the FY1947 budget authority, in constant 2011 dollars (after adjusting for inflation) the budget authority for FY1975 and FY1976 was below that of FY1947. This reflects in large part the differences between the two conflicts in terms of the timing for release of servicemembers and veterans benefits and services (compared to the pre-conflict period). During the current conflicts [Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF, which began October 2001), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF, March 2003 - August 2010), and Operation New Dawn (which began September 2010)], there is no military draft in place. Servicemembers generally leave at the end of their obligation, or at retirement. The somewhat steady increase in budget authority for veterans' benefits and administration each year since the late 1990s reflects the impact of the aging of the veteran population (with an accompanying increased demand for services) in addition to the impact of the returning OEF/OIF veterans. Also, increases in appropriations for disability compensation reflect changes to the conditions considered presumed to be service-connected for Vietnam veterans. In FY2000, of the 83,159 veterans who began receiving disability compensation that year, 19.8% were aged 55 or older. By FY2011, of the 272,509 veterans who began receiving disability compensation that year, 52.9% were aged 55 or older. The budget authority for FY2009 and later years also reflect the impact of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Program. Over time, the increases in the budget authority for veterans' benefits and services have reflected the impact of increases in the number of veterans as the result of wars and other conflicts, the aging of the veteran population, and changes in the benefits and services provided for veterans. The most dramatic impact of the combination of an increase in the number of veterans and changes in veterans' benefits can be seen in the period shortly after World War II.", "completion": "response:\nBudget authority—the amount of money a federal department or agency can spend or obligate to spend by law—for veterans' benefits and services has increased significantly since FY1940. In FY1940, the budget authority for veterans' benefits and services was $561.1 million, and in FY2012 the budget authority was $125.3 billion, or more than 200 times the FY1940 budget authority. In constant 2011 dollars (i.e., inflation-adjusted), the FY2012 budget authority is 14 times the FY1940 budget authority. The increases over time have reflected the impact of increases in the number of veterans as the result of wars and other conflicts, the aging of the veteran population, and changes in benefits and services provided for veterans.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe President is responsible for appointing individuals to positions throughout the federal government. In some instances, the President makes these appointments using authorities granted by law to the President alone. Other appointments are made with the advice and consent of the Senate via the nomination and confirmation of appoin tees. Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation are often referred to with the abbreviation PAS. This report identifies, for the 114 th Congress, all nominations submitted to the Senate for executive-level full-time positions in the 15 executive departments for which the Senate provides advice and consent. It excludes appointments to regulatory boards and commissions as well as to independent and other agencies, which are covered in other Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) at http://www.lis.gov/nomis/ , the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents , telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code , and the 2016 Plum Book ( United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions ). Related CRS reports regarding the presidential appointments process, nomination activity for other executive branch positions, recess appointments, and other appointment-related matters may be found at http://www.crs.gov . Table 1 summarizes appointment activity, during the 114 th Congress, related to full-time PAS positions in the 15 executive departments. President Barack H. Obama submitted 102 nominations to the Senate for full-time positions in executive departments. Of these 102 nominations, 64 were confirmed; 8 were withdrawn; and 30 were returned to the President under the provisions of Senate rules. The length of time a given nomination may be pending in the Senate has varied widely. Some nominations were confirmed within a few days, others were confirmed within several months, and some were never confirmed. This report provides, for each executive department nomination confirmed in the 114 th Congress, the number of days between nomination and confirmation (\"days to confirm\"). Under Senate Rules, nominations not acted on by the Senate at the end of a session of Congress (or before a recess of 30 days) are returned to the President. The Senate, by unanimous consent, often waives this rule—although not always. In cases where the President resubmits a returned nomination, this report measures the days to confirm from the date of receipt of the resubmitted nomination, not the original. For executive department nominations confirmed in the 114 th Congress, a mean of 156.1 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation. The median number of days elapsed was 125.5. Each of the 15 executive department profiles provided in this report is divided into two parts. The first table lists the titles and pay levels of all the department's full-time PAS positions as of the end of the 114 th Congress. For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule. As of the end of the 114 th Congress, these pay levels range from level I ($205,700) for Cabinet-level offices to level V ($150,200) for lower-ranked positions. The second table lists appointment action for vacant positions during the 114 th Congress in chronological order. This table provides the name of the nominee, position title, date of nomination or appointment, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation, and notes relevant actions other than confirmation (e.g., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President). When more than one nominee has had appointment action, the second table also provides statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. The average days to confirm are provided in two ways: mean and median. The mean is a more familiar measure, though it may be influenced by outliers in the data. The median, by contrast, does not tend to be influenced by outliers. In other words, a nomination that took an extraordinarily long time to be confirmed might cause a significant change in the mean, but the median would be unaffected. Examining both numbers offers more information with which to assess the central tendency of the data. For a small number of positions within a department, the two tables may contain slightly different titles for the same position. This is because the title used in the nomination the White House submits to the Senate, the title of the position as established by statute, and the title of the position used by the department itself are not always identical. The first table listing incumbents at the end of the 114 th Congress uses data provided by the department itself. The second table listing nomination action within each department relies primarily upon the LIS database of Senate nominations. This information is based upon nominations sent to the Senate by the White House. Any inconsistency in position titles between the two tables is noted following each appointment table. Appendix A provides two tables. Table A-1 relists all appointment action identified in this report and is organized alphabetically by the appointee's last name. Table entries identify the agency to which each individual was appointed, position title, nomination date, date confirmed or other final action, and duration count for confirmed nominations. The table also includes the mean and median values for the \"days to confirm\" column. Table A-2 provides summary data for each of the 15 executive departments identified in this report. The table summarizes the number of positions, nominations submitted, individual nominees, confirmations, nominations returned, and nominations withdrawn for each department. It also provides the mean and median values for the numbers of days taken to confirm nominations within each department. A list of department abbreviations can be found in Appendix B . Appendix A.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nWireless signals are subject to various types of interference, even when operating within assigned frequencies. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates commercial radio, television, commercial wireless services, and state and local public safety and other non-federal uses of radio frequency spectrum. Its primary tool in dealing with interference to wireless transmissions is to prevent it by the judicious allocation of radio frequencies, following band plans designed to preclude or minimize most types of interference. In the case of frequencies at 800 MHz, interference had been caused primarily by transmissions from commercial cell phone towers, many of which were part of Sprint Nextel's \"push to talk\" network. When the frequencies in the 800 MHz band were first assigned, the FCC did not anticipate that channels in that band intended for short messages over commercial mobile radio (used by taxi dispatchers, for example) would—with time, technology, and soaring consumer demand for wireless service—be converted to a heavily-trafficked national cell phone network. The commercial allocations at 800 MHz were closely interleaved with public safety allocations, with the expectation that the (presumably) low-usage commercial assignments would act as buffers to prevent interference with public safety channels. The FCC announced in 2004 that it had agreed upon a rebanding plan to consolidate public safety frequencies and those used by some other operators, such as utilities, in the lower part of the 800 MHz band, while moving some of the 800 MHz channels acquired by Nextel, and some other commercial users, to the higher end of the band. The band reconfiguration is expected to eliminate interference caused by the close proximity and interleaving of commercial and public safety channels. The decision reached by the FCC in general supported a rebanding plan first proposed by Nextel. After months of negotiations, clarifications and technical corrections, a modified plan was accepted in February 2005. The conversion process was scheduled to be completed by June 26, 2008. Disputes related to cost reimbursement have delayed the transition, however. Because waivers extending deadlines are granted on a case-by-case basis, the final completion date for the transition has remained uncertain. The FCC has ruled to establish December 9, 2013, as the final date for resolving all cost-sharing obligations. The news release announcing the FCC decision regarding the decision for rebanding provided a summary of key points, some of which are highlighted below. These provisions, negotiated with Nextel, apply to Sprint Nextel effective as of the date of the merger. Separate \"generally incompatible technologies\" by eliminating interleaving. Move channels designated for interoperability to the lower end of the band, close to the planned public safety band at 700 MHz. Require public safety systems to relocate to channels at 809-815 MHz and 854-860 MHz. Require certain business and industrial users to relocate to channels at 809-815 MHz and 854-860 MHz. Require Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio users, \"ESMR,\" to relocate to 817-824 MHz and 862-869 MHz. Until the band relocation plan is complete, apply \"Enhanced Best Practices\" to define and correct interference that will place \"strict responsibility on carriers to fix such interference.\" Require Nextel to give up some of its licenses at 800 MHz and all of its licenses at 700 MHz. Modify Nextel's licenses to provide the right to operate at 1910-1915 MHz and 1990-1995 MHz, \"conditioned on Nextel fulfilling certain obligations specified in the Commission's decision.\" Value the 1.9 GHz spectrum rights to be assigned to Nextel at almost $4.9 billion, less the cost of relocating incumbent users in those channels. Credit Nextel the value of the spectrum rights it is relinquishing at 700 MHz and 800 MHz plus the \"actual costs\" to Nextel in relocating \"all incumbents in the 800 MHz band.\" Require Nextel to make an \"anti-windfall payment\" to the Treasury at the conclusion of the relocation process that will equal the difference between the $4.9 billion valuation and the cumulative credits. Require Nextel to provide public safety users at 800 MHz and incumbent users at 1.9 GHz with \"comparable facilities.\" Require Nextel to establish escrow accounts and a letter of credit in the amount of $2.5 billion, to \"ensure that the band reconfiguration process will be completed.\" Provide an independent \"Transition Administrator\" to authorize disbursements, \"subject to de novo Commission review.\" The FCC rebanding plan required that Sprint Nextel pledge $2.5 billion in cash and letters of credit to cover relocation costs for public safety. Sprint Nextel's obligation to cover the costs of rebanding is not limited to $2.5 billion, however. Sprint Nextel is expected to pay all the agreed upon costs, even if this total exceeds $2.5 billion. The difference between the values of the spectrum Sprint Nextel is relinquishing and of the new spectrum it is receiving is an increase—a potential windfall—of approximately $2.8 billion. This is the value, before specified relocation costs, that Sprint Nextel might be obligated to pay the U.S. Treasury. If the rebanding plan costs reach $2.5 billion, the \"anti-windfall payment\" due the U.S. Treasury would be $300 million. If the costs exceed $2.8 billion, the Treasury receives nothing. If the costs are no more than $850 million (a preliminary estimate provided by Nextel), the payment to the Treasury could approach $2 billion. Therefore, all the relocation costs reimbursed by Sprint Nextel must be tallied and documented to be applied toward the potential anti-windfall payment. The final determination of the payment, if any, from Sprint Nextel is referred to as a true-up. Because the deadline for the completion of the rebanding has been extended several times, the deadline for the true-up has also been extended. The TA must file regular reports with the FCC with its recommendations as to whether it has sufficient information on the costs of rebanding to calculate the anti-windfall payment—if any—that Sprint Nextel will be obligated to pay, or whether the deadline must be postponed again. The Transition Administrator (TA) is an independent organization set up in accordance with FCC rules. The responsibilities of the TA are to facilitate a smooth transition and to oversee the administration and financial management of the plan. The TA is also to monitor progress in the rebanding plans and to enforce the deadlines set by the FCC. It also files quarterly reports on Frequency Realignment Agreements (FRAs) plans filed with the TA. It is the TA that requests estimates of rebanding costs from public safety and private wireless networks covered by the plan, and decides whether or not to provide funds in advance. Disagreements about the implementation of the plan that the TA cannot resolve on its own or through mediation will in most cases be referred to the FCC. The TA consists of a team provided by Deloitte Consulting LLP, Squire, Sanders, & Dempsey LLP, and Baseline Wireless Services, LLC.", "completion": "response:\nIn mid-2005, wireless communications managers commenced the process of moving selected public safety radio channels to new frequencies. This step was part of a rebanding plan to mitigate persistent problems with interference to public safety radio communications. The majority of documented incidents of interference was attributed to the network built by Nextel Communications, Inc (now Sprint Nextel). As part of an agreement originally made between Nextel and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), some public safety wireless users have moved or will move to new frequencies, with the wireless company paying all or part of the cost. The rebanding agreement was not affected by the merger between Nextel and Sprint Corporation. In return for the expenditures, and reflecting the value of spectrum that Sprint Nextel relinquished as part of the band reconfiguration, the FCC assigned new spectrum licenses to the wireless company. The FCC set the \"windfall\" value of the new licenses, after allowing for the value of the licenses being relinquished, at $2.8 billion. The costs that Sprint Nextel incurs in the rebanding process are being applied to the $2.8 billion windfall. If the total is less than $2.8 billion, Sprint Nextel will be required to make an \"anti-windfall\" payment to the U.S. Treasury for the difference. If the costs exceed $2.8 billion, Sprint Nextel is obligated to pay them without any new concessions from the FCC. The rebanding plan is being implemented by the 800 MHz Transition Administrator (TA), created by the FCC for this purpose. The TA's ongoing responsibilities are to set priorities, establish schedules, and oversee reimbursement to parties for eligible expenses associated with relocation. Disagreements about the implementation of the plan that the TA cannot resolve on its own or through mediation are in most cases referred to the FCC. From the outset, there have been debates about the transition plan, such as maintaining interoperability, scheduling, and reimbursement for costs incurred. As the band reconfiguration proceeds, debates have often become protracted negotiations—and even litigatious disputes—slowing the transition process. The original plan set a deadline of June 2008 to complete the transition, with the calculation—or true-up—of the anti-windfall payment to occur six months later. The deadline has been extended several times while issues regarding the transition process were resolved. Consequently, the deadline for the true-up has also been extended, most recently until December 9, 2013."}

Solutions may include legislation, regulation, or media attention. A clearly defined issue makes the determination of the themes for developing the message and promoting the solution easier to explain to colleagues, supporters, opponents, constituents, and the press. Next, a time line for solving the problem should be determined. Is this a one-session, or one-Congress, or longer-term project? Is it one event or a coordinated series of events? Should the event(s) be held in the Member's district or state, in Washington, or throughout the country? Prior to beginning work on the solution, an in-depth determination of the extent of the problem needs to be undertaken. For example, is the problem limited to one district, state, or region, or is it nationwide? Should the solution address the specific issue or the policy in general? Consultation with local and state officials, community leaders, and constituents is integral at this stage. Discussions in Washington may include committee and subcommittee leaders, the party leadership, think tanks, and interest groups. One of the most important decisions is whether to conduct an \"inside\" or \"outside\" strategy, or possibly a combination of the two. Inside strategy entails work within the legislative process only, that is, legislation, hearings, committee and floor amendments, floor debate, and conference consideration. Advocates may or may not be involved in any of this activity. An outside strategy calls for advocates to generate mail, press, and office visits, often to force an inside strategy to occur. A combined strategy includes using Dear Colleague letters, coordinated one-minute or special order speeches, Member-to-Member lobbying, and group press conferences. What criteria are used to determine success? Political success? Press attention? Legislative success? Other? What is the duration of the project: one event, one session of Congress, two years, or longer? Are there other projects on this topic already underway? If so, should the Member conduct an independent project, or join forces? Does the political party or state of other Members involved influence the decision? Should it? Has the project ever been tried in the past? If yes, what Members tried it? What was the result? Is the project still needed? Are there lessons to be learned from the earlier attempt? What other Members, committees, or party leaders should be involved? What advocates should be involved? Which advocates will support, and which will actively oppose, the initiative? Is legislation the appropriate remedy for the problem? Will a free-standing measure be necessary, or is there a vehicle to which an amendment can be offered? Should the Member introduce the legislation alone or seek original cosponsors? Should those cosponsors be bipartisan? Should they be of the same \"type,\" for example, women, philosophy, state and region, or district demographics, serving on the same committee? Should a companion measure be introduced in the other chamber? Should Dear Colleague letters be sent prior to introduction? Should they be sent periodically throughout the process identifying status? When should the legislation be introduced, for example, opening day, first or second session, a specific time of year? What should the legislation be titled? Is there a useful acronym to be found to assist in publicizing the legislation? Should a particular number be reserved, for example, H.R. or S. 2020 relating to eye care? Should a working group be created? Staff only or Members only? What role should the party leadership play? What of committee leadership? What type of coalitions should be created? If legislation is being considered on the issue (not necessarily the Member's measure), should the Member testify at hearings? Are there others the Member would recommend as witnesses?

Can state or local officials be given a role in promoting the project? Action plans embody the strategies employed to achieve goals. The office's strategic plan should not only identify specific steps, but also the person(s) (including the Member) responsible for each step. It is also useful to include deadlines for completing action on each step. Periodic meetings to review progress on the plan may prove useful in keeping the project on track. Usually each person in the office, whether they have specific responsibility for parts of the plan, should be provided a copy of the plan. Identify appropriate executive branch agency(s). Meet with agency staff to review present programs and discuss legislative options. Meet with advocates to discuss problem and possible solutions.

Alternative fuel vehicles include vehicles powered by nonpetroleum fuels such as natural gas, electricity, or alcohol fuels. Advanced technology vehicles include hybrid vehicles, which combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor system to boost efficiency. Often, these vehicles are more expensive than their conventional counterparts. Further, fueling the vehicles is often inconvenient because the number of refueling stations for alternative vehicles is negligible compared with the number of gasoline stations nationwide; in some regions, the infrastructure is nonexistent. However, many of these vehicles perform more efficiently and are better for the environment than conventional vehicles. There has been significant interest in promoting these vehicles as a response to environmental and energy security concerns. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 , §1913) established individual and business tax incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles and for the installation of alternative fuel infrastructure. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ) expands these existing tax incentives and creates new ones. Incentives existing prior to P.L. 109-58 include the Electric Vehicle Tax Credit; the Clean Fuel Vehicle Tax Deduction; and tax deduction for the installation of alternative fuel infrastructure. For 2005, a federal tax credit is available worth 10% of the purchase price of an electric vehicle, up to a maximum of $4,000 (26 U.S.C. 30). The credit, which was not extended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, will be reduced to a maximum of $1,000 in 2006 and will be phased out completely after 2006. For the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles, as well as hybrid electric vehicles, a Clean Fuel Vehicle Tax Deduction (26 U.S.C. 179A) is available. The amount of the deduction is based on the weight of the vehicle. Vehicles under 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight (i.e., cars and light trucks) qualify for a $2,000 deduction in 2005; those between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds qualify for a $5,000 deduction. Vehicles above 26,000 pounds qualify for a $50,000 deduction. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 terminates this deduction after December 31, 2005, and replaces it with a tax credit (see below). Prior to 2002, hybrid electric vehicles were not considered \"clean-fuel vehicles\" because the primary fuel for the vehicles is gasoline. However, in May 2002, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that taxpayers can claim the deduction for qualified hybrids. As of December 2005, eight hybrid models are eligible for the deduction. Businesses that install alternative fuel refueling infrastructure can claim a tax deduction of up to $100,000 (26 U.S.C. 179A). The Energy Policy Act of 2005 eliminates this deduction at the end of 2005 and replaces it with a tax credit (see below). The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded and extended the existing tax incentives for nonconventional vehicles. These new incentives are similar to those proposed in the Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies Act (CLEAR ACT, S. 971 ) and the Volume Enhancing Hardware Incentives for Consumer Lowered Expenses Technology Act (VEHICLE Technology Act, H.R. 626 ), as well as legislation discussed in the 108 th Congress. Among other provisions, Sections 1341 and 1342 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 contain several tax incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. For example, the act replaces the existing clean-fuel vehicle tax deduction with a new tax credit for hybrid vehicles; creates a tax credit for the purchase of lean-burn passenger vehicles; creates a new tax credit for the purchase of fuel-cell vehicles; replaces the existing clean-fuel vehicle tax deduction with an alternative fuel vehicle tax credit; and replaces the existing deduction for the installation of refueling infrastructure with a tax credit. Each of these credits is discussed below; Table 4 summarizes each one. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the existing clean-fuel vehicle deduction for hybrid electric vehicles is replaced with a tax credit after 2005. The amount of the credit is based on several factors. For passenger vehicles, these factors are the fuel economy increase and the expected lifetime fuel savings when compared with a conventional vehicle of comparable weight. To qualify for the credit, a hybrid vehicle must meet certain emissions standards and technical specifications. For heavy-duty vehicles (more than 8,500 pounds), the credit is based on the fuel economy relative to a comparable vehicle, as well as the incremental cost of the hybrid vehicle above the cost of the conventional vehicle. The range of potential credits for each vehicle weight are shown in Table 1 . The hybrid vehicle credit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2009. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that 2006 tax credits for hybrid passenger vehicles will range from $0 (Honda Insight) to $3,150 (Toyota Prius). However, the IRS has not yet announced the value of the credits for 2006. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a tax credit for the purchase of passenger vehicles with \"lean-burn\" engines. For the most part, diesel-powered vehicles that meet certain emissions and fuel economy standards would qualify for the tax credit, which is structured like the hybrid tax credit and ranges from $400 to $3,400, based on fuel economy and fuel savings. The credit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. However, no lean-burn passenger vehicles are available that meet the emission standard. Consequently, no vehicles on the market qualify for the credit, although many observers expect automakers to look for ways to reduce the emissions of such vehicles in future years so that the vehicles can qualify. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a tax credit for the purchase of fuel-cell vehicles. The credit increases with gross vehicle weight, as shown in Table 1 . Passenger vehicles that achieve at least 50% better fuel economy than a comparable conventional vehicle also qualify for an additional tax credit of between $1,000 and $4,000, depending on overall fuel economy. The credit expires at the end of calendar year 2014. However, because of technical and cost concerns, no fuel-cell vehicles are commercially available, and the development of a mass-market fuel-cell vehicle in the near future seems unlikely. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 replaces the existing clean-fuel vehicle tax deduction with a credit for the purchase of a new alternative fuel vehicle (AFV). The new credit is equal to a percentage of the incremental cost of the AFV, subject to certain maximum dollar amounts. The incremental cost is the difference between the higher cost of the AFV and its conventional counterpart. Under the act, the applicable percentage is 50% of the incremental cost plus an additional 30% if the vehicle meets certain emissions requirements. The maximum credit is based on the weight of the vehicle, as shown in Table 3 . The credit expires at the end of 2010. To qualify for the credit, the vehicle is required to be a \"dedicated\" AFV, meaning that it must not be capable of operating on conventional fuel. This provision is a response to criticisms of previous AFV policies that included \"dual-fuel\" vehicles. In many cases, dual-fuel vehicles operate solely on gasoline. Because some alternative fuels must be blended with a small amount of gasoline (e.g., ethanol, methanol), vehicles using these fuels qualify for a prorated tax credit. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 replaces the existing deduction for the installation of alternative fuel infrastructure with a tax credit. The credit is equal to 30% of the purchase or installation cost of the refueling property, subject to a maximum dollar amount. For retail property, the maximum credit is $30,000. For residential property, the maximum is $1,000. The credit expires after 2014 for hydrogen infrastructure; the credit for all other fuels expires after 2009.", "completion": "response:\nAlternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles face significant market barriers, such as high purchase price and limited availability of refueling infrastructure.

Although the Interagency Policy Committee has met regularly to develop a governmentwide food security strategy, the group has yet to publish its strategy. However, the Interagency Policy Committee has established an objective to help rural farmers feed themselves and to help countries establish sustainable agriculture systems by (1) investing in country-led food security plans, (2) coordinating stakeholders strategically, (3) supporting multilateral mechanisms, (4) ensuring a sustained commitment, and (5) focusing on a comprehensive approach to agriculture productivity. The Interagency Policy Committee has also identified seven principles for its food security strategy, including the following: stimulate postharvest and private sector growth, support women and families, maintain the natural resource base, expand knowledge and training, increase trade flows, and support an enabling policy environment. Based on information provided by USAID and USDA and our own analysis, we determined that recommendation 2 has not been implemented. USAID officials stated that they plan to update Congress on progress toward implementation of a governmentwide food security strategy as part of the agency’s 2008 Initiative to End Hunger in Africa report; the full version of this report was not publicly available as of September 2009. A summary report provided by USAID identifies three food security pillars—(1) immediate humanitarian response, (2) urgent measures to address causes of the food crisis, and (3) related international policies and opportunities—used to respond to the 2007 and 2008 global food crisis. However, the governmentwide strategy has not yet been finalized, and it is premature to report on its implementation. Oversight Questions 1. What coordination and integration mechanisms has the U.S. government established to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of U.S. international food assistance? 2. What is the nature and scope of current U.S. global food security activities? What agencies, programs, and funding levels are involved? How are NGOs, international organizations, foreign governments, and host governments involved in these efforts? 3. What progress have U.S. agencies made in developing an integrated governmentwide global food security strategy? What are the goals and timeframe for the implementation of the strategy? 4. What key criteria has the U.S. government developed to assess the implementation of the global food security strategy? Does the U.S. government plan to report annually to Congress on the results of the strategy?", "completion": "response:\nThe number of individuals experiencing hunger has grown to more than 1 billion worldwide in 2009, up from a record 963 million in 2008, according to the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). FAO attributes this upsurge in hunger to the global economic crisis, which followed rising food and fuel prices from 2006 to 2008. However, even before these crises, the number of undernourished people had been increasing annually in sub-Saharan Africa--where some of the world's food needs are greatest--underscoring the need to improve international food assistance. International food assistance includes both emergency food aid and long-term food security programs. Due to rising food prices, increasing conflicts, poverty, and natural disasters, in 2007, a record 47 countries--27 located in Africa--faced food crises requiring emergency assistance, according to FAO. To address these emergencies, countries provide food aid as part of a humanitarian response to address acute hunger through either in-kind donations of food or cash donations. In-kind food aid is food procured and delivered to vulnerable populations, while cash donations are given to implementing organizations, such as the UN World Food Program (WFP), to procure food in local and regional markets, also referred to as local and regional procurement (LRP). International food assistance also includes a development-focused response to address long-term chronic hunger through food security programs. While food aid has helped to address the immediate nutritional requirements of some vulnerable people in the short term, it has not addressed the underlying causes of persistent food insecurity. Our objectives were to (1) update U.S. agencies' responses to GAO's previous international food assistance recommendations and (2) identify potential oversight questions for congressional consideration. Since 1996, we have published 18 products that provided insight, many with recommendations, on international food assistance. Specifically, in the past 3 years, we issued four reports with 16 recommendations to improve the efficiency of U.S. food aid and food security programs. Over the course of our work, we also identified improvements that were needed, as well as obstacles that affect the success of program planning and implementation. As a result, we have identified five issues for Congressional consideration to ensure more efficient and effective international food assistance: (1) coordination and integration, (2) needs assessments and market information, (3) transportation and logistics, (4) nutrition and food quality control, and (5) monitoring and evaluation."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOn May 24, 2010, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Lewis v. City of Chicago , a case involving questions regarding the timeliness of disparate impact discrimination claims filed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or religion. In Lewis , a group of aspiring black firefighters sued the City of Chicago over its repeated use of an employment test with racially disproportionate results to hire several new groups of firefighters over a six-year period. The city argued that the applicants, who filed their claim almost two years after the employment examination was administered, had exceeded the statutory deadline for filing claims under Title VII, while the applicants claimed that the city committed a fresh act of discrimination each time it relied upon the test to hire a new class of firefighters, thus repeatedly restarting the clock on the filing deadline. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the applicants for the firefighting positions, holding that such disparate impact claims may be brought each time an employer uses the results of a discriminatory test to hire. In 1995, over 26,000 applicants seeking to join the Chicago Fire Department took an employment examination administered by the city. Based on the scores of the examination, the city established three groups of applicants: those who were \"well-qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified.\" On nine occasions, the city selected new hires from the pool of well-qualified candidates, although on the last occasion the city also hired applicants from the qualified group once it had exhausted the pool of well-qualified candidates. These nine hirings occurred over a six-year period. In 1997, a group of black applicants who scored in the qualified range filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claiming that the city's practice of initially hiring only from the well-qualified group, which was 75.8% white and only 11.5% black, had an unlawful disparate impact on the basis of race. Subsequently, they filed a Title VII suit in federal court, and the district court certified a class of more than 6,000 black applicants who had scored in the qualified range but had not been hired. Although the city stipulated that its classification of applicants as either well-qualified or qualified had had a disparate racial impact, it sought summary judgment on the ground that the applicants had failed to file their EEOC claim within the statutorily mandated deadline. The district court rejected this argument and later ruled in favor of the applicants, ordering the city to hire 132 members of the class and awarding back pay to the rest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's decision, holding that the applicants had failed to meet the statutory filing deadline because \"[t]he hiring only of applicants classified 'well qualified' was the automatic consequence of the test scores rather than the product of a fresh act of discrimination.\" The Supreme Court granted review in order to determine \"whether a plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adoption of a practice—here, an employer's decision to exclude employment applicants who did not achieve a certain score on an examination—may assert a disparate-impact claim in a timely charge challenging the employer's later application of that practice.\" Under Title VII, two different types of discrimination are prohibited. The first is disparate treatment, which involves intentional discrimination, such as treating an individual differently because of his or her race. The second type of prohibited discrimination—at issue in Lewis —is disparate impact, which involves a neutral employment practice that is not intended to discriminate but that nonetheless has a disproportionate effect on protected individuals. An employer may defend against a disparate impact claim by showing that the challenged practice is \"job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity,\" although a plaintiff may still succeed by demonstrating that the employer refused to adopt an available alternative employment practice that has less disparate impact and serves the employer's legitimate needs. Regardless of whether they allege disparate impact or disparate treatment, individuals who want to challenge an employment practice as unlawful are required to file a charge with the EEOC within a specified period—either 180 days or 300 days, depending on the state—\"after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" The question that arose for the Supreme Court in Lewis was whether the city's subsequent use, rather than its initial adoption, of a discriminatorily tiered hiring system constituted an unlawful employment practice for purposes of starting the clock on the filing deadline. Ultimately, the Court ruled unanimously in favor of the applicants, holding that such disparate impact claims may be brought when a plaintiff challenges an employer's subsequent application of an earlier-adopted discriminatory practice. In its brief opinion, the Court relied on the text of Title VII to determine that the city's refusal to hire those applicants whose scores fell below the well-qualified range constituted an \"employment practice,\" and thus concluded that the applicants could proceed with their suit because they had established a prima facie disparate impact claim by showing, as Title VII requires, that the employer \"uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact.\" In rejecting the city's contention that the only actionable discrimination occurred when it first established cutoff scores for the well-qualified and qualified groups of applicants, the Court distinguished its rulings in several earlier cases, including Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , a 2007 case in which the Court held that a plaintiff's Title VII claim was untimely, rejecting her argument that each paycheck she received reflected a lower salary due to past discrimination and thus constituted a new violation of the statute. According to the Court, its previous cases \"establish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a 'present violation' within the limitations period.\" In Ledbetter , which involved a disparate treatment claim and therefore required a showing of discriminatory intent, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that such intentional discrimination had occurred within the filing period. In a disparate impact case such as Lewis , however, no such showing of discriminatory intent is required, and the Court therefore concluded that the applicants' claim was cognizable. Finally, the Court addressed the practical implications of its decision. According to the city, the Court's decision will cause numerous problems for employers, including new disparate impact lawsuits that challenge employment practices that have been used for years and difficulty defending against such suits after many years have passed. The Court noted, however, that a different reading of the statute would produce equally puzzling results: under the city's interpretation, \"if an employer adopts an unlawful practice and no timely charge is brought, it can continue using the practice indefinitely, with impunity, despite ongoing disparate impact.\" Likewise, litigation could increase if employees who are afraid of missing the filing deadline decide to challenge new employment practices before it is clear whether such practices have a disparate impact. Ultimately, the Court noted that its task is not to address the practical implications of its decision but rather to give effect to the statute. In enacting Title VII, \"Congress allowed claims to be brought against an employer who uses a practice that causes disparate impact, whatever the employer's motives and whether or not he has employed the same practice in the past. If the effect was unintended, it is a problem for Congress, not one that the federal courts can fix.\"", "completion": "response:\nThis report discusses Lewis v.

The term \"political organization\" includes entities intending to influence federal, state, and local elections, along with the selection of non-elective offices. The term \"political committee\" is narrower, covering only those entities participating in federal election activities. While political committees are a type of political organization, not all political organizations are political committees. In general, Section 527 political organizations are required to report tax-related information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Other information, such as disclosure of contributions and expenditures, is reported to either the IRS or the Federal Election Commission (FEC) depending on whether the political organization is also a political committee. Those that are political committees report to the FEC; while political organizations that are not political committees report to the IRS. Section 527 political organizations include the entities colloquially known as \"527s\" or \"527 groups\" that have been controversial during recent election cycles. These groups, which benefit from Section 527 tax-exempt status, seemingly intend to influence federal elections in ways that may place them outside the FECA definition of \"political committee.\" Because these groups are not registered as political committees under FECA, they are required to report information to the IRS, instead of the FEC. The following chart compares the timing of election activity reporting requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code and the Federal Election Campaign Act. No legislation has yet been introduced in the 111 th Congress that would amend the timing of the reporting requirements in the IRC or FECA. In the 110 th Congress, H.R. 1204 (527 Transparency Act of 2007) would have no longer allowed Section 527 political organizations to file the periodic contribution and expenditure reports with the IRS on a non-monthly basis. Instead, all political organizations that report to the IRS would have been required to file monthly reports, in addition to pre-election, post-general election, and year-end reports. An organization that failed to file in a timely fashion would have faced a penalty equal to 30% of the expenditures and contributions that were not adequately reported, with the organization's managers jointly and severally liable for the penalty. Additionally, contributions to that organization would have been subject to the gift tax. The organizations would have been required to notify their contributors about the failure within 90 days of the IRS's final determination that the failure had occurred.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nSeveral types of investments are preferentially treated under the individual income tax, including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), pensions, capital gains, dividends, owner occupied housing, and life insurance policy earnings. There are two types of IRAs that have the effect of exempting investment earnings from tax—the traditional (deductible) IRA and the Roth IRA. For the deductible IRA (also called a front-loaded IRA), contributions are deducted when made and withdrawals are taxed; this treatment is similar to the treatment of pensions. Eligibility for the deductible IRA is phased out as income increases for individuals who are active participants in employer pension plans. (Individuals above the income phase-out can make non-deductible contributions, with earnings taxed when withdrawn, which allows deferral, but not elimination, of taxes.) There are penalties for early withdrawal and mandatory distribution requirements. As described above, IRAs were treated the same way as pension plans, with contributions deductible and withdrawals taxable. The Roth IRA (also called a back-loaded IRA), was added as an option in 1997, when eligibility for both types of IRAs was expanded. The tax treatment of this account is similar to that of a tax exempt bond: earnings are simply not taxed. The earnings phase-outs are higher and treatment is, in general, more generous than in the case of the deductible IRA. The annual deduction limit for IRA contributions when expanded in 1997 was the lesser of $2,000 or 100% of compensation; that limit was increased under the temporary provisions of the 2001 tax cut and eventually made permanent at $5,000. The 2001 act also introduced a tax credit for contributions by low income individuals. Favorable tax treatment of pensions, namely allowing the firm to deduct contributions which are not included in employees income and exempting the earnings of pension trusts as in the case of deductible IRAs, has been in place almost since the inception of the tax law. Pensions fall into two types: defined benefit plans where payments depend on earnings and years of service at retirement, and defined contribution plans where payments depend on the amount accumulated in an account. Pensions are subject to many rules and regulations designed to ensure that tax benefits do not accrue to owners and highly compensated managers and that pension trusts are adequately funded in the case of defined benefit plans. Of course to the extent that pension assets (or IRA assets) are invested in corporate stock, tax is collected at the corporate level. Tax benefits for pension plans are much more important in dollar terms than are tax benefits for IRAs. For FY2009, according the latest Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates, employer pensions resulted in a revenue loss of $120.4 billion, with plans for self-employed individuals (called Keogh plans) costing $9.5 billion. IRAs resulted in a loss of $18.5 billion. In the case of dividends, about half of the income is not subject to tax because of tax preferred status. There are other savings and investments that receive favorable treatment under the individual income tax. Capital gains has historically been favorably treated, both through lower tax rates, deferral (taxed only when realized), and forgiveness of tax if passed on at death. Dividends are also now eligible for lower tax rates. Of course, earnings on corporate stock are taxed under the corporate tax. Owner occupied housing is also favorably treated because imputed rent is not included in income, and earnings on investments in life insurance policies are deferred and, when passed on via death benefits, exempt from tax. These tax benefits are significant as well. Lower rates for capital gains and dividends are estimated by the JCT to lose $131.0 billion in FY2009, the failure to tax gains at death $57.5 billion, and the deferral of gain for gifts $5.9 billion. While there is not a separate estimate for excluding imputed rent, the value of deducting costs (even though gross rent is not included in income) through itemized deductions is $85.2 billion for mortgage interest and $14.2 billion for property taxes. The exemption of most capital gains on homes is estimated to cost $30.1 billion. The value of deferral and forgiveness of earnings on life insurance policies is $27.5 billion. IRAs were expanded by the 2001 tax bill, H.R. 1836 , which was signed into law on June 7, 2001. IRA limits increased to $3,000 in 2002, $4,000 in 2005 and $5,000 in 2008, with indexation afterwards. Individual 50 and over had an extra $500 increase in 2002 and will have a $1,000 increase in 2008. This bill also increased contribution limits for pension plans, including 401(k) plans. Because of budget rules the tax cuts in this bill were sunsetted in 2010, but the increased limit was made permanent by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Pension Protection Act also allowed a rollover of IRA amounts to charity for those aged 70 and ½ without incurring tax effects. This provision expired after 2007 but may be reinstated along with other extenders. President Bush proposed in his FY2004 through FY2009 budget plans to eliminate the deductible IRA form. His proposal would rename the Roth IRAs as Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs), and also allow Lifetime Savings Accounts (LSAs). The contribution limits would be greatly increased (to $5,000 for each type of account under the most recent proposal) and the income limits would be eliminated. Individuals could roll over existing accounts into these new accounts, by paying tax on the rollovers, which would increase revenue in the short run. The latest proposal is expected to initially gain and then lose revenue, with loss in the tenth year of $.5 billion. In the long run, the provision would cost much more. His proposal would also combine a variety of employer savings accounts into a single account and simplify the rules designed to prevent discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees. This proposal might form part of an the President's proposal for fundamental tax reform. The Enron scandal and the slow recovery of the economy led to legislative proposals regarding pensions in the 107 th Congress that did not see completion and were not addressed in the 108 th Congress. However, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 eventually provided a variety of revisions and liberalizations of pension policy. The original rationale for IRAs, first introduced in 1962, was to provide parity with individuals covered by employer pensions. IRAs were made universally available in 1981, with the primary rationale to encourage savings. Income limits that disallowed deductible IRA coverage for most individuals were adopted as part of the base broadening in the 1986 Tax Reform Act; the 1997 legislation increased these limits and introduced Roth IRAs. All but the very high income individuals and couples now have access to IRAs. There has been considerable debate among economists about the effect of IRAs on savings. Some statistical studies have found powerful savings effects of IRAs and have argued that advertising of the tax benefit has caused people to save. Others have disputed the evidence from those studies and argued that there is no historical evidence of an IRA savings effect, and that economic theory does not support such an effect. Still others have argued that IRAs are less important in increasing overall savings than the more generous thrift savings accounts (e.g., 401(k) plans) provided through employers. Although the dollar contribution ceilings and income limits on IRAs keep the provision from providing benefits to very high income individuals, IRAs do generally benefit well-off individuals who are more likely to save. The evidence that lower taxes on the return to investments increase savings in general is mixed. Income and substitution effects, which in the one case lower and the other case raise savings, may net out to little or no effect, and most simple evidence suggests that savings rates do not change very much as tax rules change (although there has been a trend downward in private savings rates).", "completion": "response:\nSeveral types of savings are eligible for beneficial treatment under the individual income tax, and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) have received considerable attention. Pension savings are actually more important in terms of revenue loss. There are other investments that are treated favorably as well. The President has proposed in a succession of budgets to significantly expand IRAs. Effects of these provisions on savings are uncertain, and, despite dollar limits on contributions and income phase outs, IRAs tend to benefit higher income individuals."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nH.R. 6 was introduced by the House Democratic Leadership to revise certain tax and royalty policies for oil and natural gas and use the resulting revenue to support a reserve for energy efficiency and renewable energy. The bill is one of several introduced on behalf of the Democratic Leadership in the House as part of its \"100 hours\" package of legislative initiatives conducted early in the 110 th Congress. Title I proposes to reduce certain oil and natural gas tax subsidies to create a revenue stream to support energy efficiency and renewable energy. Title II would modify certain aspects of royalty relief for offshore oil and natural gas development to create a second stream of revenue to support energy efficiency and renewable energy. Title III of H.R. 6 creates a budget procedure for the creation and use of a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Reserve, under which additional spending for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs can be accommodated without violating enforcement procedures in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. The stated purpose of the bill is to \"reduce our nation's dependency on foreign oil\" by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Specifically, Section 301 (a) of the bill would make the revenue in the Reserve available to \"offset the cost of subsequent legislation\" that may be introduced \"(1) to accelerate the use of domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels, (2) to promote the utilization of energy-efficient products and practices and conservation, and (3) to increase research, development, and deployment of clean renewable energy and efficiency technologies.\" The budget adjustment procedure for use of the Reserve is set out in Section 301 (b). The procedure is similar to reserve fund procedures included in annual budget resolutions. It would require the chairman of the House or Senate Budget Committee, as appropriate, to adjust certain spending levels in the budget resolution, and the committee spending allocations made thereunder, to accommodate a spending increase (beyond FY2007 levels) in a reported bill, an amendment thereto, or a conference report thereon that would address the three allowed uses of the Reserve noted above. The adjustments for increased spending for a fiscal year could not exceed the amount of increased receipts for that fiscal year, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, attributable to H.R. 6 . According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the proposed repeal of selected tax incentives for oil and natural gas would make about $7.7 billion available over 10 years, 2008 through 2017. The proposed changes to the royalty system for oil and natural gas are estimated to generate an additional $6.3 billion. This would yield a combined total of $14 billion for the Reserve over a 10-year period. The CBO estimates show that the total annual revenue flow would vary annually over the 10-year period, ranging from a low of about $900 million to a high of about $1.8 billion per year. H.R. 6 came to the House floor for debate on January 18, 2007. In the floor debate, opponents argued that the reduction in oil and natural gas incentives would dampen production, cause job losses, and lead to higher prices for gasoline and other fuels. Opponents also complained that the proposal for the Reserve does not identify specific policies and programs that would receive funding. Proponents of the bill countered that record profits show that the oil and natural gas incentives were not needed. They also contended that the language that would create the Reserve would allow it to be used to support a variety of R&D, deployment, tax incentives, and other measures for renewables and energy efficiency, and that the specifics would evolve as legislative proposals come forth for to draw resources from the Reserve. The bill passed the House on January 18 by a vote of 264-163. In general, the budget resolution would revise the congressional budget for FY2007. It would also establish the budget for FY2008 and set budgetary levels for FY2009 through FY2012. In particular, the House resolution ( H.Con.Res. 99 ) would create a single deficit-neutral reserve fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy that is virtually identical to the reserve described in H.R. 6 . In contrast, the Senate resolution ( S.Con.Res. 21 ) would create three reserve funds, which identify more specific efficiency and renewables measures and would allow support for \"responsible development\" of oil and natural gas. On March 28, the House passed H.Con.Res. 99 by a vote of 216-210. For FY2007, it would allow for additional funding for energy (Function 270) above the President's request that \"could be used for research, development, and deployment of renewable and alternative energy.\" Section 207 would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund that fulfills the purposes of H.R. 6 to \"facilitate the development of conservation and energy efficiency technologies, clean domestic renewable energy resources, and alternative fuels that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\" On March 23, the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 21 , its version of the budget resolution. In parallel to the House resolution, Section 307 of S.Con.Res. 21 would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund that could be used for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and \"responsible development\" of oil and natural gas. In addition, Section 332 would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund for extension through 2015 of certain energy tax incentives, including the renewable energy electricity production tax credit (PTC), Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, and provisions for energy efficient buildings, products, and power plants. Further, Section 338 would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund for manufacturing initiatives that could include tax and research and development (R&D) measures that support alternative fuels, automotive and energy technologies, and the infrastructure to support those technologies.", "completion": "response:\nH.R. 6 would use revenue from certain oil and natural gas policy revisions to create an Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. The actual uses of the Reserve would be determined by ensuing legislation. A variety of tax, spending, or regulatory bills could draw funding from the Reserve to support liquid fuels or electricity policies. The House budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 99) would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund nearly identical to that proposed in H.R. 6. The Senate budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 21) would create three reserve funds with purposes related to those in H.R. 6. However, the Senate version has more specifics about efficiency and renewables measures, and it would allow reserve fund use for \"responsible development\" of oil and natural gas."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nFast-track is an expedited procedure for congressional consideration of certain trade agreements. This process is tied to the President's authority provided by Congress to enter into trade agreements to reduce U.S. tariff and non-tariff barriers with other countries. The fast-track authority provides that Congress will consider trade agreement implementing bills within mandatory deadlines, with a limitation on debate, and without amendment, as long as the President meets prescribed requirements set out by law. Under the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (P.L. 73-316), Congress delegated renewable authority to the President to negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions. The Trade Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-618 ) expanded this authority to include negotiations of nontariff trade barriers, but required more extensive reporting and consultations between Congress and the President during trade negotiations. This act also had a provision under which Congress would consider implementing bills for trade agreements under expedited congressional procedures, known as fast-track. Table 1 shows how Congress renewed fast-track authority on particular dates. In the years following the expiration of fast-track authority in 1994, there were several legislative proposals to reauthorize the trade authority procedures; these bills, including H.R. 2621 in the 105 th Congress, did not pass. In the 107 th Congress, several legislative proposals on trade promotion authority (TPA) were considered. The original House version of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act ( H.R. 3005 ) passed by one vote on December 6, 2001 (215-214). Another bill, H.R. 3009 , was amended several times in the House and the Senate to include additional trade issues. Following House and Senate negotiations and agreement to the conference report for H.R. 3009 , the President signed H.R. 3009 , as P.L. 107-210 , the Trade Act of 2002, on August 6, 2002. This major piece of trade legislation has the TPA provisions in Title XXI, Section 210l, as the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. TPA procedures apply to implementing bills for trade agreements entered into before July 1, 2007. Although TPA expired on July 1, 2007, four proposed U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) were signed in time to be considered by Congress under TPA procedures in the 110 th Congress; the U.S. FTAs were negotiated separately with the countries of Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The implementing legislation for the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement was passed by Congress and signed by the President on December 14, 2007 ( P.L. 110-138 ). Also in the 110 th Congress, H.R. 5724 was introduced as implementing legislation for the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. On April 10, 2008, the House passed H.Res. 1092 , relating to H.R. 5724 ; this resolution provided a rule that disallowed the use of time limitations for consideration of the implementing bill. No further legislative action on H.R. 5724 occurred in the 110 th Congress. In the 111 th Congress, no legislation for the three proposed U.S. trade agreements (with the countries of Colombia, Panama, and South Korea) was introduced. The fate of the three FTAs is uncertain in the 112 th Congress. More detailed information on congressional and executive procedures for TPA and free trade agreements can be found in the \"Resources for Additional Information,\" at the end of this report. In Table 1 , some of the listed bills focus solely on fast-track trade negotiating authority or TPA. Other bills are major landmarks of trade legislation , of which fast-track is only one of many trade provisions. These major trade acts, in boldface, include the Trade Act of 1974, the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and the Trade Act of 2002. Congress has applied fast-track legislative procedures to approve several reciprocal bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. Table 2 lists the uses of fast-track procedures in the implementation of trade agreements from 1979 to the present. The table does not include the implementing legislation for the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement ( H.R. 2603 enacted as P.L. 107-43 on September 28, 2001); Congress did not consider this bill under fast-track procedures. In the 108 th Congress, implementing legislation for free trade agreements was passed under fast-track procedures on four separate bills: H.R. 2738 , the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, was signed on September 3, 2003 ( P.L. 108-77 ). On the same day, H.R. 2739 , the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, was signed into law ( P.L. 108-78 ). H.R. 4759 , the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement Act, was signed by the President on August 3, 2004 ( P.L. 108-286 ). On August 17, 2004, H.R. 4842 , the U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, was signed into law ( P.L. 108-302 ). In the 109 th Congress, implementing legislation for three free trade agreements was passed under fast-track procedures on three separate bills: H.R. 3045 , the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (CAFTA-DR), was signed by the President on August 2, 2005 ( P.L. 109-53 ). H.R. 4340 , the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, was signed into law on January 11, 2006 (P.L. 109-169). H.R. 5684 , the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, was signed into law on September 26, 2006 (P.L. 109-283). Although TPA expired on July 1, 2007, four proposed FTAs (with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea) were signed in time to be considered by Congress under TPA procedures in the 110 th Congress. H.R. 3688 , the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act, was passed by the House on November 8, 2007, and by the Senate on December 4, 2007. This bill was signed into law on December 14, 2007 (P.L. 110-138). In the 110 th Congress, H.R. 5724 was introduced to implement the proposed U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. H.Res. 1092 was introduced as a rule change for consideration of H.R. 5724 only; this resolution disallowed the use of time limitations for consideration of the implementing bill under fast-track procedures. H.Res. 1092 passed the House on April 10, 2008 (224-195). No further legislative action on H.R. 5724 occurred in the 110 th Congress. In the 111 th Congress, no implementing legislation for the three proposed FTAs (with the countries of South Korea, Colombia, and Panama) was introduced. In the 112 th Congress, the fate of the three proposed FTAs is uncertain.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nWhen a Senator introduces a bill or joint resolution, the measure is usually referred to committee, pursuant to provisions of Senate Rules XIV, XVII, and XXV. When the House informs the Senate that it has passed a bill or joint resolution that was introduced in the House, and the Senate receives the measure, the measure is also usually referred to a Senate committee. (Senate rules contain procedures for processing concurrent and simple resolutions (Rule XIV, paragraph 6), treaties (Rule XXX), and nominations (Rule XXXI), which are not covered in this report.) Senate Rule XIV, paragraph 2 requires that bills and resolutions have three readings before passage, and that they be read twice before being referred to committee. (The \"third reading\" occurs before a vote on final passage.) Although a Senator may demand (under paragraph 2) that the readings occur on three different legislative days, bills and joint resolutions may be read twice on the same day \"for reference\" (referral) if there is no objection (under paragraph 3). Most bills and resolutions are read twice and referred to committee on the same day that they are introduced by a Senator or received from the House. The Senate may, however, use provisions of Senate Rule XIV to bypass referral of a bill or joint resolution to a Senate committee in order to have the measure placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business. The calendar's General Orders section lists measures eligible for Senate floor consideration. Broadly, the two purposes of preventing the referral of a bill or joint resolution to a committee and placing it directly on the calendar are (1) to facilitate the full Senate's opportunity to consider the measure; or (2) to bypass a committee's potential inaction or, to the measure's sponsor, potential hostile action. Although placing a bill or joint resolution directly on the calendar does not guarantee that the full Senate will ever consider it, the measure is available for floor consideration and certain procedural steps, such as committee reporting or discharging a committee from a bill's consideration, and procedural requirements, such as the two-day availability of a committee report, may be obviated. In this report, the terms bill ( s ) or measure ( s ) refer to bills and joint resolutions. Senate Rule XIV, paragraph 4, states: \"... every bill and joint resolution introduced on leave, and every bill and joint resolution of the House of Representatives which shall have received a first and second reading without being referred to a committee, shall, if objection be made to further proceeding thereon, be placed on the Calendar .\" ( Emphasis added .) Therefore, through objection, a bill or joint resolution after two readings is prevented from being referred to committee and is placed directly on the calendar. It is usually the majority leader (or another Senator in his stead), acting on his own or at the request of any other Senator, who objects to \"further proceeding\"—committee referral—on a measure. For example, this procedure was used to place S. 1035 directly on the calendar. On April 21, 2015, the presiding officer recognized Majority Leader McConnell for this colloquy with the chair: Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the desk, and I ask for its first reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the first time. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill ( S. 1035 ) to extend authority relating to roving surveillance, access to business records, and individual terrorists as agents of foreign powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and for other purposes. Mr. McCONNELL. I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to my own request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative day. In the next edition of the Senate's Calendar of Business on April 22, this action was recorded in the section Bills and Joint Resolutions Read the First Time. The measure was pending at the desk (of the presiding officer). Since objection had been heard to the second reading, the presiding officer recognized Majority Leader McConnell the next legislative day, April 22: Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk due for a second reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the second time. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill ( S. 1035 ) to extend authority relating to roving surveillance, access to business records, and individual terrorists as agents of foreign powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and for other purposes. Mr. McCONNELL. In order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the bill will be placed on the calendar. S. 1035 had received its second reading, but there was objection to further proceeding on referral of the bill to committee. The presiding officer, under Rule XIV, ordered that the bill be placed on the Senate Calendar. In the calendar beginning April 23, S. 1035 appeared as Calendar Order No. 60 in the section General Orders, with other measures eligible for floor consideration. This same procedure is followed to have House-passed bills and joint resolutions placed directly on the Senate Calendar. Bills and joint resolutions are also sometimes placed on the calendar by unanimous consent. (For a fuller examination of the Senate's use of the Rule XIV procedure and other procedures and actions to bypass committees, and also both to bypass committees and pass legislation, see CRS Report RS22299, Bypassing Senate Committees: Rule XIV and Unanimous Consent , by Michael L.

Service for less than a full session in a Congress is disregarded. A rules change adopted on January 7, 2003, pursuant to H.Res. 5 , exempted the Intelligence Committee chair from the limit. A rules change adopted on January 4, 2005, pursuant to H.Res. 5 , exempted the Rules Committee chair from the limit. In 2009, the Democratic majority removed term limits from House rules. The rules adopted on January 3, 2013, reinstituted term limits for all committee chairs, but continued the exemption for the Rules Committee chair. Republican Conference rules delineate procedures for the selection of standing committee chairs and ranking minority members. The Speaker, with the Republicans in the majority, has the authority to nominate the chairs of the House Administration Committee and Rules Committee. In the minority, these appointments are made by the minority leader. The Speaker's or minority leader's nominations for these two positions are submitted directly to the full Republican Conference for ratification. If the conference rejects the leader's nominee, the Speaker or minority leader has the authority to submit another name to the conference. All other standing committee chairs or ranking minority members are nominated by the Republican Steering Committee and ratified by the full Republican Conference. Pursuant to conference rules, the Member nominated to be chair or ranking minority member does not need to be the Member with the longest continuous service on the committee. In recent Congresses, the Steering Committee \"interviewed\" prospective candidates for chair or ranking slots. Some of the new chairs and ranking members have been the most senior members of the committee, others were not. The Steering Committee is composed of party leaders, selected committee leaders, class leaders, and regional representatives. The Steering Committee is reconstituted each Congress. Regions are restructured to reflect as closely as possible an equal number of Republican Members from each region. Each region elects its Steering Committee member. If Steering Committee members are elected from states that have four or more Republican Members, a \"small state\" group is triggered to also elect a member to the Steering Committee; the small state group is composed of states that have three or fewer Republican Members. On November, 19, 2015, the House Republican Conference adopted a conference resolution redesigning the composition of the Steering Committee. The chairs of the Committees on Appropriations, Budget, Energy and Commerce, Financial Services, Rules, and Ways and Means were removed, except when the Steering Committee is considering members for election to one of those specific committees. If, for example, a member is elected to the Ways and Means Committee, that committee's chair would join the Steering Committee to deliberate and vote on the new member. Six members are to be elected by the conference as at-large members. The Speaker has the authority to appoint one at-large designee. The Speaker, who previously had five votes, will have four votes. The conference resolution stated that elections for the at-large members would be held not later than 30 calendar days after the resolution was adopted. The six members receiving the greatest number of votes would be elected. The Republican Conference elected the six members on December 10, 2015. It is anticipated that the number of regions and the regional allocation will be reviewed in the near future. Table 1 depicts the membership of the reconstituted Republican Steering Committee as of July 1, 2017. Democratic Caucus rules address selecting committee chairs and ranking minority members. The Democratic leader nominates a chair and ranking member for the Committees on Rules and House Administration, who must be approved by the entire Democratic Caucus. The Budget Committee chair and ranking member are selected from among members choosing to run for the position. Other chair and ranking Member nominations are made by the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee and voted on by the entire Democratic Caucus. In making selections, the Steering Committee considers, pursuant to caucus rules, \"merit, length of service on the committee and degree of commitment to the Democratic agenda of the nominee, and the diversity of the Caucus.\" The Steering Committee is reconstituted each Congress, and regions can be restructured to reflect equal Democratic representation among regions. The number of appointments made by the party leader can also change.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nOn March 16, 2016, President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia on February 13, 2016. Judge Garland was appointed to the D.C. Circuit in April 1997, and since February 2013 has served as the circuit court's Chief Judge, an administrative position that rotates among the active judges on the circuit. During his nearly two decades on the bench, Judge Garland has served on three-judge or en banc D.C. Circuit panels that have made rulings in well over 1,000 cases. He has also served on a few panel decisions at the district court level. Cases considered by Judge Garland have concerned a wide range of legal topics ranging from rulemaking by federal administrative agencies, to criminal law and procedure, to the review of legal challenges arising under the local laws of the District of Columbia. To assist Members and committees of Congress and their staff in their ongoing research into Judge Garland's approach to the law, this report identifies and briefly summarizes each of the more than 350 cases in which Judge Garland has authored a majority, concurring, or dissenting opinion. Arguably, these written opinions provide the greatest insight into Judge Garland's judicial approach, as a judge's vote in a case or decision to join an opinion authored by a colleague may be based upon a number of considerations and may not necessarily represent full agreement with a joined opinion. This report does not address instances when Judge Garland sat on a reviewing judicial panel but did not author an opinion. Accordingly, instances where Judge Garland was part of a panel that issued a per curiam opinion, which did not credit a particular judge as the author, are omitted from this report. The report also does not address subsequent legal proceedings that may have occurred after a cited decision was issued. The opinions listed in this report are categorized into two tables: one table identifying opinions authored by Judge Garland on behalf of the reviewing court, and the other table identifying opinions authored by Judge Garland separate from the majority opinion. Cases are listed in reverse chronological order by date of decision. In each case, the key ruling or rulings of the case are succinctly described. Judicial opinions discussed in this report are categorized using the following 19 legal subject areas: Administrative law Civil liability (e.g., tort preemption, arbitration, class actions, statutory right to sue) Civil rights Criminal law/procedure D.C. local government Election law Environmental law Energy Federalism Federal courts (e.g., standing to sue, civil procedure) First Amendment (e.g., freedom of speech, freedom of the press) Government information (e.g., claims concerning the Freedom of Information Act) Health care (e.g., Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement) International law Labor law National security Separation of powers Tax law Transportation Where appropriate, multiple subject areas are identified as relevant to a particular case. The list above is not an exhaustive accounting of all possible subject areas addressed by the cases below, but focuses on those legal topics that have most frequently arisen in cases adjudicated by Judge Garland. Moreover, the fact that a case is categorized under a particular legal subject area does not necessarily mean that some observers might not deem other categories to be pertinent. For example, several cases concerning the disposition of challenges brought by wartime detainees held at the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are categorized solely under the legal subject area of \"National security,\" though some observers may believe that such cases also could be deemed to fall under the \"Separation of powers\" category (because they arguably concern judicial review of executive discretion in wartime matters) or the \"Administrative law\" category (because such cases often involve review of determinations made through an administrative process employed by the U.S. military to assess whether a person is properly detained as an enemy belligerent). Accordingly, while the categorizations employed by this report may provide a helpful guide to readers in locating decisions dealing with particular topics, they do not necessarily reflect the full range of legal issues raised by a judicial opinion. While this report identifies and briefly describes those opinions authored by Judge Garland during his tenure on the federal court, it does not analyze the implications of his judicial opinions or suggest how he might approach legal issues if appointed to the Supreme Court. Those matters are discussed in CRS Report R44479, Judge Merrick Garland: His Jurisprudence and Potential Impact on the Supreme Court , coordinated by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed]. The cases included in this report were compiled utilizing the following methodology: The majority opinions were found by searching the District of Columbia Circuit—U.S. Court of Appeals database on Lexis for OpinionBy(Garland).

The dissenting opinions were found by searching the District of Columbia Circuit—U.S. Court of Appeals database on Lexis for DissentBy(Garland) . Concurring or dissenting opinions issued in cases where Judge Garland wrote the majority opinion were found by searching the District of Columbia Circuit—U.S. Court of Appeals database on Lexis for OpinionBy(Garland ) , and limiting those results by searching for Judges(concur! or dissent!) . District court opinions in which Judge Garland is credited as an author were found by searching the District of Columbia Circuit—U.S. District Court Cases database on Lexis for Judges(Garland) . Not all results from these searches ultimately proved to be relevant, such as when the D.C. Circuit declined a petition for en banc rehearing in a one-sentence decision joined by all of the reviewing judges. That decision and similar rulings are not discussed in this report. Ultimately, this methodology resulted in the identification of 355 instances in which Judge Garland is credited as an author of a judicial opinion in cases either before the D.C. Circuit (354 cases) or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (a single case).", "completion": "response:\nOn March 16, 2016, President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C.

To assist Members and committees of Congress and their staff in their ongoing research into Judge Garland's approach to the law, CRS attorneys have prepared tabular listings of cases in which Judge Garland authored an opinion. These opinions are categorized into two tables: one table identifying opinions authored by Judge Garland on behalf of the reviewing court, and the other table identifying opinions authored by Judge Garland that concur with or dissent from the majority opinion. While this report identifies and briefly describes judicial opinions authored by Judge Garland during his tenure on the federal court, it does not analyze the implications of his judicial opinions or suggest how he might approach legal issues if appointed to the Supreme Court.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nHistorically, crime control has been the responsibility of local and state governments, with little involvement from the federal government. However, as crime became more rampant in the United States, the federal government increased its support for domestic crime control by creating a series of grant programs designed to assist state and local law enforcement. In the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, Congress created the Edward Byrne Memorial Formula Grant (Byrne Formula Grant) program and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) program, along with other grant programs, to assist state and local law enforcement in their efforts to control domestic crime. In 2005, however, legislation was enacted that combined the Byrne Formula Grant and LLEBG programs into the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program. This report provides background information on the JAG program. It begins with a discussion of the programs that were combined to form the JAG program: the Byrne Formula Grant and LLEBG programs. The report then provides an overview of the JAG program. This is followed by a review of appropriations for JAG and its predecessor programs going back to FY1998. As mentioned, prior to creating the JAG program in the middle part of the past decade, Congress provided federal assistance to state and local governments for a variety of criminal justice programs through the Byrne Formula Grant and LLEBG programs. Each program is briefly described below. The Byrne Formula Grant program was authorized by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-690 ). Funds awarded to states under the Byrne Formula Grant program were to be used to provide personnel, equipment, training, technical assistance, and information systems for more widespread apprehension, prosecution, adjudication, detention, and rehabilitation of offenders who violate state and local laws. Grant funds could also be used to provide assistance (other than compensation) to victims of crime. Twenty-nine \"purposes areas\" were established by Congress to define the nature and scope of the programs and projects that could be funded with the formula grant funds. The purpose of the LLEBG program, which was also a formula grant program, was to provide units of local government with federal grant funds so they could either hire police officers or create programs that would combat crime and increase public safety. Like the Byrne Formula Grant program, LLEBG had program purpose areas outlining what types of programs LLEBG funds could support. There were six program purpose areas that governed how state and local governments could use their funding under the LLEBG program. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-162 ) combined the Byrne Grant programs and LLEBG into the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program (JAG). Congress consolidated the programs to streamline the process for states applying for funding under the programs. JAG funds are allocated to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, America Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The formula used by the JAG program to allocate funds combines elements of the formulas used in the Byrne Formula Grant program and LLEBG. Under the current JAG formula, the total funding allocated to a state is based on the state's population and reported violent crimes. Specifically, half of a state's allocation is based on a state's respective share of the United States' population. The other half is based on the state's respective share of the average number of reported violent crimes in the United States for the three most recent years for which data are available. Under current law, each state and territory is guaranteed to receive no less than 0.25% of the amount appropriated for the JAG program in a given fiscal year (i.e., the minimum allocation). Therefore, after each state's allocation is calculated using the JAG formula, if a state's allocation is less than the minimum allocation, the state receives the minimum allocation as its award. If a state's initial allocation was greater than the minimum amount, then the state receives the minimum allocation plus a share of the remaining funds based on the state's proportion of the country's population and the reported number of violent crimes (population and violent crime data for the states that received the minimum allocation as their award are excluded when allocating the remaining funds for the states that receive more than the minimum allocation). After each state's allocation is calculated, 40% of the state's allocation is directly awarded to units of local government. Awards to units of local government under JAG are made the same way they were under LLEBG; namely, each unit of local government's award is based on the jurisdiction's proportion of the average number of violent crimes committed in its respective state. Only units of local government that would receive $10,000 or more are eligible for a direct allocation. The balance of funds not awarded directly to units of local government is administered by the state, which must be distributed to state police departments that provide criminal justice services to units of local government and to units of local government who were not eligible to receive a direct award from Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). Also, like the Byrne Formula Grant program, each state is required to \"pass through\" a certain percentage of the funds directly awarded to the state. For JAG, the pass-through percentage is calculated as the ratio of the total amount of expenditures on criminal justice by the state for the most recent fiscal year to the total amount of expenditures on criminal justice by both the state and all units of local government in the past fiscal year. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 consolidated the program purpose areas under the Byrne Formula Grant and LLEBG programs into a total of seven program purpose areas under the JAG program. The seven broad program purpose areas are intended to give states and local units of government flexibility in creating programs to address local needs. JAG funds can be used for state and local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and criminal justice information systems to improve or enhance such areas as law enforcement programs; prosecution and court programs; prevention and education programs; corrections and community corrections programs; drug treatment programs; planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs; and crime victim and witness programs (other than compensation). The program purposes areas are broad enough to allow programs funded under the Byrne Grant program and LLEBG to continue to be funded under JAG. Funding for JAG has averaged $440 million per fiscal year since Congress started appropriating funding for the program in FY2005. However, as shown in Table 1 , funding for the program fluctuated over that time period. The appropriations data also show that there has been a general downward trend in providing assistance to state and local law enforcement through these formula grant programs. Trends in funding for the Byrne Formula Grant, LLEBG, and JAG programs roughly mirror those of other Department of Justice (DOJ) grant accounts. The amounts appropriated for JAG over the fiscal years have been below the amount authorized for the program, which was $1.095 billion per fiscal year for FY2006-FY2012. Since funding was authorized for the program in FY2006, the most Congress appropriated for JAG—$546 million for FY2009—represented 50% of the amount authorized per fiscal year.", "completion": "response:\nThe Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program was created by the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-162), which collapsed both the Edward Byrne Memorial Formula (Byrne Formula) Grant and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) into a single program. This report provides a brief overview of JAG and its funding. JAG funds are awarded to state and local governments based on a statutorily defined formula. Each state's allocation is based on its proportion of the country's population and the state's proportion of the average total number of reported violent crimes (homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) for the last three years. After a state's allocation is calculated, 60% goes directly to the state government and the remaining 40% is awarded directly to units of local government in the state. State and local governments can use their JAG funding for programs or projects in one of seven purpose areas: (1) law enforcement programs; (2) prosecution and court programs; (3) prevention and education programs; (4) corrections and community corrections programs; (5) drug treatment programs; (6) planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs; and (7) crime victim and witness programs (other than compensation).

Prior to thisperiod, Indonesia had enjoyed relatively healthy economic growth: from 1980-1989, real GDP growth averaged5.5%, and from 1990 to 1996, it averaged 8.0%(one of the highest GDP growth rates in the world). According to the World Bank, the proportion of people livingbelow poverty declined from 60% in 1970 toan estimated 11% by mid-1997. (3) The 1997 economic crisis (which began in Thailand and quickly spread to Indonesia and several other East Asian economies), (4) resulted in a sharp depreciationof Indonesia's currency (the rupiah), (5) large-scalecapital flight, high inflation, widespread corporate bankruptcies (caused in part by large short-term debt ofmany companies and corrupt business practices), and a near collapse of the banking system. (6) In 1998, real GDP plunged by 13.2%; exports andimports fell by 8.6% and 34.5%, respectively, and living standards (per capita GDP on a purchasing power parity basis) droppedby nearly 13% (see Table 1 ). Finally , thepoverty rate doubled between mid-August 1997 (pre-crisis) and late 1998/early 1999. (7) Political unrest followed the economic crisis, eventually leading to the resignation in May 1998 of President Suharto (or Soeharto) who had ruled the countrysince 1967. The collapse of the Suharto regime helped usher in a new era of democratic political reforms inIndonesia, although the transition to democracy hasnot been easy and political instability remains a problem. Indonesia's near economic meltdown forced it to turn tointernational lending institutions, such as theInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and foreign governments for billionsof dollars in loans, debt rescheduling, andeconomic aid. Indonesia has been somewhat successful in bringing the economy back to at least pre-crisis levels, but several problems remain. On the positive side, real GDPfrom 2000-2003 grew at a relatively healthy pace, averaging 4.0% (although it was half the average level of realGDP growth during the early 1990s). Inaddition, Indonesia's living standards (measured according to per capita GDP in purchasing power parity) finallyreached and exceeded pre-crisis levels in 2002($3,320 in 2002 versus $3,201 in 1997). Living standards improved by 12.7% in 2003. Finally, Indonesian exports (in dollar terms) in 2003 were 6.6% higherthan 1997 levels. On the negative side, Indonesian imports in 2003 were 21.1% lower than pre-crisis levels,reflecting the effects of the sharp devaluation of therupiah. In addition, the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indonesia dropped each year from 1997-2002. While the stock of FDI is estimated to haverisen slightly in 2003, it is $14.8 billion (or 20.3%) lower than what it was in 1997. (8) Finally, the rate of unemployment in Indonesia has steadily risen over thepast few years, from 6.1% in 2000 to 8.7% in 2003. Table 1. Selected Economic Indicators for Indonesia's Economy: 1997-2003 Source: Economist Intelligence Unit and government of Indonesia. Data for 2003 are estimates. *PPP data are measurements of foreign data in national currencies converted into U.S. dollars based on a comparable level of purchasing power these datawould have in the United States. The short-term economic prospects for Indonesia are relatively positive. For example, Global Insight , an international forecasting firm, predicts thatIndonesia's real GDP will rise by 4.6% in 2004 and 5.0% in 2005. (9) However, Indonesia faces a number of challenges that threaten to undermine long-termgrowth prospects. These include widespread government corruption and a weak legal system, (10) large public debt, extensive government controlof keyeconomic sectors (such as oil and gas), a high level of corporate non-performing loans, a weak banking system,uncertainties surrounding the centralgovernment's efforts to decentralize fiscal and political authority to local governments, and failure by thegovernment to provide adequate protection ofintellectual property rights (IPR). In addition, the existence and activities of several separatist movements andterrorist groups in Indonesia constitute majorthreats to political and economic stability. (11) InOctober 2002, terrorists with reported links to Al Qaeda bombed a club in Bali frequented by western tourists,killing over 200 people (including seven Americans) and wounding hundreds more. (12) In August 2003, terrorists bombed a U.S.-run hotel in Jakarta , killing12 people and wounding 150. The bombings have had a chilling effect on Indonesia's tourism industry and raisedmajor concerns over the safety of foreigntourists and businesspeople in Indonesia. Ethnic, religious, and separatist violence in the country has displaced 1.3million Indonesians. (13) According to the World Trade Organization, Indonesia was the world's 28th largest exporter and the 39th largest importer in 2002. Indonesian trade data indicatethat Japan was its largest trading partner in 2002, followed by the United States, Singapore, South Korea, and China(see Table 2 ). The United States wasIndonesia's second largest export market and its third largest source of imports. Major Indonesian exports includedpetroleum and petroleum products, naturalgas, and clothing and accessories. Its major imports were petroleum and petroleum products, organic chemicals,and general industrial machinery. (14) According to Indonesian investment statistics (which record approved investment, as opposed to actual investment),the top five foreign investors in Indonesiaare the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore, China, and Malaysia. Major sectors for FDI in Indonesia includechemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper; metal goods,transportation, and real estate. (15) Table 2. Indonesia's Major Trading Partner's: 2002 ($billions) Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development U.S. data indicate that Indonesia is not a large U.S. trading partner. In 2003, U.S. exports to, and imports, from Indonesia were $2.5 billion and $9.5 billion,respectively, making Indonesia the 37th largest U.S. export market and its 26th largestsource of imports. As indicated in Table 3 and figure 1 , U.S. exports toIndonesia declined sharply in 1998 and 1999 and have been relatively flat since. Overall, U.S. exports to Indonesiain 2003 were 44.4% lower than 1997 levels. U.S. imports from Indonesia grew slightly from 1997-2000, but have been relatively flat since. U.S. imports fromIndonesia in 2003 were only 3.6% higherthan 1997 levels. The top three U.S. exports to Indonesia in 2003 were soybeans, textile fibers, and animal feed,while the top U.S. imports from Indonesiawere clothing and apparel, telecommunications equipment (mainly audio and video equipment), and crude rubber. According to U.S. investment data (whichlists the value of U.S. FDI on a historical cost basis, i.e., the cumulative book value of investment), U.S. FDI inIndonesia stood at $7.5 billion at year-end 2002,down by $700 million from 2001 and by $1.4 billion from its peak in ($8.9 billion) in 2000. Currently, 77% of U.S.FDI in Indonesia is in the mining sector(mainly oil and gas). (16) Because Indonesia is a developing country and meets other criteria set in U.S. law, $1.3 billion worth of its exports entered the United States duty-free under theGeneralized System of Preferences (GSP). In an effort to boost U.S.-Indonesian commercial relations, promotepolitical stability in Indonesia, and combatterrorism, the Bush Administration on September 19, 2001 announced that the United States would add 11 productsimported from Indonesia (valued at about$100 million) that would be eligible for GSP treatment and pledged that the United States would provide up to $400million in financial aid and loan guaranteesunder U.S. trade programs operated by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the Export-ImportBank (Eximbank), and the Trade andDevelopment Agency (TDA), largely targeted at Indonesia's oil and gas sector. Indonesia has gradually reformed its trade regime over the past 10 years, reducing its average un-weighted tariff from 20.0% in 1994 to 7.3% in 2003. In 1999,Indonesia agreed to eliminate various discriminatory trade policies on auto trade after it lost a case in the WTOdispute brought mainly by the United States andEuropean Union. Indonesia's enforcement of U.S. IPR has been a major issue of concern for U.S. firms. Accordingto the International Intellectual PropertyAlliance (IIPA), piracy levels in Indonesia are \"among the highest in the world,\" rivaling those of China andVietnam. IIPA estimates that IPR piracy inIndonesia cost U.S. firms $260 million in lost trade in 2002. (17) Table 3.

The length of the Alaska-Canada border alone is 1,538 miles. The tables below list the 13 U.S. states that share international boundaries with Canada and the four states that share an international border with Mexico, with information from the International Boundary Commission and the U.S. Geological Survey. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has surveyed the coastline of the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii several times. The current figures for the coastline are the results of the measurements done originally in 1915 and updated several times thereafter. These figures reflect the general outline of the seacoast. The figures for Alaska reflect a 1961 remeasurement. It is important to note that boundary and coastline distances can differ significantly based on the scale used on the maps or charts. The Canadian and Mexican international borders are less problematic than the coastline measures because there are long stretches that are straight, such as the nearly 900-mile section of the U.S.-Canadian border along the 49 th parallel. Coastline measurements are more difficult because of the effects of tides and the necessarily arbitrary decisions that must be made about measuring bays, coves, islands, and inlets leading to streams and rivers. The \"general coastline\" data in this report are based on large scale nautical charts, resulting in a coastline measure for the 50 states totaling12,383 miles. Another measure using smaller scale nautical charts more than doubles this measurement to 29,093 miles, while the figures used by the NOAA in administering the Coastal Zone Management program (16 U.S.C. §1451) come to 88,612 miles (not including the Great Lakes). Table 3 provides figures for the areas of the U.S. coastline bordering international waters. It measures the coastline of the contiguous states from northeast to northwest. Similar to problems mentioned above regarding measuring coastlines, variations in shoreline figures appear due to natural occurrences, including bays and inlets, and in differing methods of measurement. These shoreline lengths were measured in 1970 by the International Coordinating Committee on the Great Lakes Basic Hydraulic and Hydrologic Data.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Fed directly changes two interest rates. The first, called the discount rate , is an administered rate explicitly set by the Fed. It is the rate at which the Fed lends short-term funds to banks, pursuant to P.L. 96-221 , the Monetary Control Act of 1980. It is determined by the seven-person Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The second, known as the federal funds rate , is a market rate at which banks lend to each other overnight to meet their \"reserve requirements \" and other liquidity needs. The Fed sets a target for this rate and historically has bought and sold primarily U.S. Treasury securities with an aim to achieving the target, which speedily becomes known to market participants. It is decided by a 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which includes each member of the board plus a varying five-person roster selected from among the 12 regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents (among the 12, the New York bank is always represented on the FOMC). On January 6, 2003, the Board of Governors announced a fundamental change to the setting of the discount rate. Henceforth, it was to be made a \"penalty\" rate for those banks who chose to borrow from the Federal Reserve to meet temporary reserve deficiencies as opposed to borrowing in the federal funds market (the \"penalty\" aspect of the discount rate comes from the fact that it is set above the target for federal funds). A primary discount rate of 2¼% was initially set for banks judged to be in a sound financial condition, whereas banks whose financial condition was judged to be riskier would be required to pay a higher secondary rate of 2¾%. This change in operating procedure is shown in Table 1 . Since the onset of the financial crisis in the summer of 2007, the Fed has not made an issue of whether banks borrow at the discount window or in the federal funds market even though the discount rate remains slightly higher than the target rate for federal funds. Because the discount rate is administered, changes in it are stated explicitly and all transactions with the Federal Reserve are at that rate. Hence, the changes shown in Table 1 are the relevant transactions rate. However, because the federal funds rate is market determined, it may vary from day to day or within a day from the announced target set by the FOMC. Thus, the federal funds rates shown in Table 1 are the target rates. Reference to the available financial data may show rates in the federal funds market that vary somewhat from the target in response to shifts in market conditions. At its December 16, 2008 meeting, the FOMC, for the first time, set a range for the federal funds target. This is because it was having difficulty holding the actual federal funds rate at the 1% target rate set on October 29, 2008. For much of the period between that date and December 16, the actual federal funds rate was substantially below the 1% target. The Fed tries to keep the economy operating at an output level consistent with a low rate of inflation and low unemployment. It therefore seeks a level of interest rates at which the economy will grow at its potential to produce. The interest rate levels consistent with this growth rate vary with the course of the business cycle. Different rates are judged appropriate at different times. Changes in the federal funds target are the most visible signs of shifts in Fed monetary policy stance and they immediately affect financial institutions and markets of all kinds here and abroad. Unusual financial market conditions such as those related to the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, the Russian debt crisis of 1998, the terrorist attacks of September 2001, and the financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007 also influence Fed decisions on rate changes. The Fed reports to Congress twice yearly on its monetary policy including rate changes, in oversight hearings in February and July as originally required by P.L. 95-188 , the Federal Reserve Reform Act. Since 2001, the stance of monetary policy has varied considerably. Initially, it was aimed at setting an expansion in motion. To do this, the federal funds target was reduced from 5½% in March 2001 to 1% in June 2003. It remained at 1% for a year. As the expansion gathered momentum, the target was raised gradually to 5¼%, in 17 equal increments spread over two years. Even as the FOMC drew attention to upward movements in the core rate of inflation at various meetings during 2006 and 2007, it continued to express the view that inflation would moderate over time, as would the rate of growth of GDP. These reasons appear to be important for leaving the rate unchanged at 5¼% for more than a year. However, during the late summer of 2007, the fall in housing prices and conditions in financial markets related to the difficulty in refinancing subprime mortgages and extending credit in general became a matter of great concern. To ease these conditions, the Board of Governors on August 17, 2007, reduced the discount rate for primary credit to 5¾%. This was followed on September 18 with another reduction of ½% and a reduction in the federal funds target to 4¾%. Additional cuts of ¼% in both rates were approved on October 31 and December 11, 2007. On January 22, 2008, the target was reduced by ¾% and on January 30 by a further ½%. The economy began to soften in the third quarter of 2007 (GDP growth was negative, falling at an annual rate of -0.2%). In the first quarter of 2008 it was positive again, and rose at an annual rate of 0.9%. During the second quarter, growth was also positive and at an annualized rate of 2.8%. Unhappily, GDP contracted again in both the third and fourth quarters and, again, during the first quarter of 2009 (it contracted at a 6.3% annual rate during 2008:4 and 6.1% during 2009:1) . The unemployment rate began to rise on a sustained basis beginning in February 2008 and, 13 months later, in March, 2009, it had risen to 8.5% from 4.8%. Job losses since the employment peak in December 2007 are some 5.1 million. As conditions in financial markets worsened and the economy softened, the FOMC and the Board approved further reductions in the federal funds target and discount rate during 2008. Both rates were lowered on March 18, April 30, October 8, October 29, and December 16, and the discount rate was reduced itself on March 16. They now stand at a range of 0% to ¼% and ½%, respectively. As these developments were taking place, the world price of energy began to rise at a brisk rate. Rising energy prices threatened to boost the overall rate of inflation, posing a challenge to the Fed's mandated commitment to stable prices. Initially, the Fed reacted by holding the federal funds target steady. However, as the magnitude and international scope of the credit crisis became apparent and energy and other commodity prices began to fall, the target was lowered and the Fed undertook a number of new and innovative measures to shore up the financial system and contain the economic contraction. These measures, as well as traditional monetary policy measures, have been unprecedented in their magnitude. During March 2008, the total reserves of depository institutions were $44.3 billion, of which $41.3 billion were required. One year later, total reserves were $780 billion, of which only $55.3 billion were required. Initiatives announced on March 17, 2009, should add nearly $2 trillion to total reserves over the remainder of 2009. The next scheduled meeting of the FOMC is June 23-24, 2009. For further discussion, see CRS Report RL30354, Monetary Policy and the Federal Reserve: Current Policy and Conditions , by [author name scrubbed].", "completion": "response:\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided at its scheduled meeting, held on April 29, 2009, to leave unchanged the target rate for federal funds, which is now at a range from 0% to ¼%. In doing so, it took notice of its previous decision to add up to $1.75 trillion to the reserves of depository institutions by purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities ($1.25 trillion), agency debt ($200 billion), and Treasury securities ($300 billion). It also repeated that other measures had been adopted to facilitate the flow of credit to households and small businesses. In making its decision, the FOMC stressed that while the pace of the economic contraction appears to have slowed somewhat, the following factors remain: (1) a continuing pattern of job losses, lower household wealth, and tight credit; (2) the decline in global demand is increasing; and (3) while inflationary pressures remain subdued, they may be inconsistent with longer term growth and price stability (meaning that the United States may be facing deflation in the future). Nevertheless, a gradual recovery of sustainable economic growth in the context of price stability is expected to begin, given Fed action to stabilize financial markets and institutions and the monetary and fiscal stimulus now in place. The FOMC pledged to employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth in a stable price environment. It expects that this will require an exceptionally low federal funds target for some time. The Board of Governors also decided to keep unchanged the discount rate for primary credit at ½%. The next scheduled meeting of the FOMC is set for June 23-24, 2009. This report will be updated as events warrant."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nWhen a President dies, a number of activities and events are set in motion. The vast majority of these activities and events are governed by custom rather than statute, and may be influenced by the wishes of the deceased President's family. Typically, the incumbent President issues a presidential proclamation that serves as an official announcement of the death. By federal law, U.S. flags should be flown at half-staff for 30 days. In recent decades, presidential proclamations have also given specific guidance where the flag should be flown at half-staff, such as \"at the White House and on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels of the United States for a period of 30 days from the day of his death. I also direct that for the same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half-staff over their Embassies, Legations, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and stations.\" The Commanding General, Military District of Washington, U.S. Army is responsible for state funeral arrangements, as described in detail in the Army pamphlet entitled State, Official, and Special Military Funerals . According to this document, the current President, ex-President, President-elect, and any other person specifically designated by the current President are entitled to an official state funeral. An excerpt from the pamphlet on key responsibilities and delegations follows: 3. Responsibilities. a. The President notifies the Congress that he has directed that a State Funeral be conducted. The Congress, which has sole authority for use of the U.S. Capitol, makes the Rotunda available for the State Ceremony through its own procedures. b. The Secretary of Defense is the designated representative of the President of the United States. The Secretary of the Army is the designated representative of the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of making all arrangements for State Funerals in Washington, D.C. This includes participation of all Armed Forces and coordination with the State Department for participation of all branches of the Government and the Diplomatic Corps. c. The Commanding General, Military District of Washington, U.S. Army as the designated representative of the Secretary of the Army, will make all ceremonial arrangements for State Funerals in Washington, D.C. and will be responsible for the planning and arranging of State Funerals throughout the continental United States. Many variations of ceremonies and traditional events and activities honoring the former President are possible. A short list of possibilities may include the following: A former President's remains may lie in repose for one day and then be moved to the Capitol Rotunda to lie in state , during which time a funeral ceremony and public viewing may occur . A former President, as former C ommander-in- C hief, is entitled to burial and ceremony in the Arlington National Cemetery. If , however, the former President is to be buried outside of Washington, DC , honors may be rendered at a train station, terminal, or airport that serves as a point of departure for the remains.Other honors that may be rendered during ceremonies include musical honors , gun and cannon salutes , and a U.S. Air Force coordinate d flyover . Most recently, following former President Gerald R. Ford's death on December 26, 2006, President George W. Bush announced the death, and also issued a proclamation that U.S. flags on all federal facilities be flown at half-staff. Two days later, President Bush issued Executive Order 13421, which proclaimed January 2, 2007, a day of respect and remembrance for the former President and ordered the closing of federal offices and agencies. A funeral took place in the Capitol Rotunda on December 30, 2006, where former President Ford lay in state, with subsequent services on January 2, 2007, at Washington National Cathedral. Funeral services for the former President were conducted on January 3, 2007, in Grand Rapids, MI, with interment at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195; 22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), enacted at the behest of President Kennedy, sought to organize and implement U.S. foreign assistance programs with a commitment to long-range economic assistance to the developing world. The President, in a \"Special Message to the Congress on Foreign Aid,\" delivered March 22, 1961, described the U.S. foreign aid programs emerging from World War II as [b]ureaucratically fragmented, awkward and slow, its administration is diffused over a haphazard and irrational structure covering at least four departments and several other agencies. The program is based on a series of legislative measures and administrative procedures conceived at different times and for different purposes, many of them now obsolete, inconsistent and unduly rigid and thus unsuited for our present needs and purposes. Its weaknesses have begun to undermine confidence in our effort both here and abroad. President Kennedy went on to note the declining prestige of the United States' foreign aid apparatus and the negative impact of that decline on administering and staffing programs abroad. The President also cited the uneven and undependable short-term financing of programs and the resulting disincentive for long-term efficient planning. Congress and the executive branch worked together to enact the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to address these shortcomings at a time when much of the developing world was emerging as newly independent states, when those new nations were, \"without exception ... under Communist pressure,\" and when \"the free industrialized nations\" found themselves in a position \"to assist the less-developed nations on a long-term basis ... [as they find themselves] on the threshold of achieving sufficient economic, social and political strength and self-sustained growth to stand permanently on their own feet.\" Though the original Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 lengthened the authorization time frame for funding development assistance to five years, other programs were authorized for shorter periods. The act still required occasional reauthorization legislation to renew programs beyond that original time frame, and Congress retained its role of appropriating funds. The original act authorized the funding levels shown in Table 1 . Through 1985, Congress regularly enacted new authorization legislation or amended the original act to update authorization time frames, and to incorporate newer programs and authorities. From 1986 on, however, Congress turned more frequently to enacting freestanding authorities that did not amend the 1961 act, and included language in annual appropriations measures to waive the requirement to keep authorizations current. Thus, sections in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, in many instances, do not refer to authorization beyond fiscal years 1986 and 1987 (unless the program was added to the act by an amendment enacted after that period), but programs are continued through appropriations. A few programs are established outside the statutory framework of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and thus are not included in detail in this report. Reimbursable military exports, for example, are addressed in the Arms Export Control Act and subsequent Security Assistance Acts. Since 1985, the last year Congress passed a comprehensive reauthorization of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, both Congress and the President have promoted a variety of specialized authorities in freestanding legislation. And, on rare occasion, Congress has established new authorities or programs in annual appropriations acts. Some freestanding laws that authorize foreign aid or apply new conditions to aid authorized in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 are shown in Table 2 . Table 3 presents the authorities enacted in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and the corresponding appropriations that fund those authorities in the current foreign assistance appropriations act. The left-side column of Table 3 cites sections of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, that authorize programs, and provides the latest year for which authorization is enacted. Sections that establish a need for such a program—in the form of policy or finding statements, for example—are not cited. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is organized in a conventional manner, however, so those sections that state policy, findings, program requirements, or implementing structure can be found in the text of the law in sections proximate to the authorizing section. All of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is stated in the United States Code, beginning at 22 U.S.C. 2151. For each section that states the President's power to authorize funds, the relevant U.S. Code citation and year of enactment is included here. In nearly all cases, these sections have been substantially amended, or rewritten altogether, subsequent to enactment. This table reflects the language as amended. Though the sections generally afford the President the authority to furnish whatever assistance the section establishes, Section 622(a) and (c) (22 U.S.C. 2382(a), (c)) of the act states that Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to infringe upon the powers or functions of the Secretary of State.... Under the direction of the President, the Secretary of State shall be responsible for the continuous supervision and general direction of economic assistance, military assistance, and military education and training programs, including but not limited to determining where there shall be a military assistance (including civic action) or a military education and training program for a country and the value thereof, to the end that such programs are effectively integrated both at home and abroad and the foreign policy of the United States is best served thereby. In many instances, the President has delegated his authority to the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, or some other appropriate office holder. Delegations of authority are to be found, either in whole text or as a reference, in the U.S. Code, at sections corresponding to the section of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 that states the relevant authority. The right-side column of Table 3 states appropriations levels that correspond to the authorized program, as enacted in the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2012 (division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012; P.L. 112-74 ; 125 Stat. 786 at 1164). The General Provisions title in an appropriations act usually states conditions for administering the appropriations. In Table 3 , General Provisions sections that state conditionality and terms that might be applicable to the aid being provided are also listed, and a statute citation is provided to assist the reader who might wish to read in further detail. General Provisions measures that apply to the entire appropriations act are cited only at Chapter 1—Policy, Development Assistance Authorizations; they are numerous and apply to most authorities. Such General Provisions sections prohibit assistance for reasons relating to terrorism, military overthrows, and debt arrearages, to name a few. ", "completion": "response:\nThe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195; 22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) serves as the cornerstone for the United States' foreign assistance policies and programs. Written, passed, and signed into law at what some consider the height of the Cold War, the act is seen by some today as anachronistic. Ironically, when President Kennedy urged the 87th Congress to enact foreign aid legislation that would exemplify and advance the national interests and security strategies of the United States post-World War II, he described the existing foreign aid mechanisms as bureaucratic, fragmented, awkward, and slow. Some have used the same language today, more than 50 years later, to characterize the legislation he promoted. On several occasions over the past 20 years, Congress has set out to assess the current body of law that comprises foreign aid policy, starting with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations Committees, in recent past Congresses, have considered legislation to rebuild the United States' capacity to deliver effective foreign aid, and make aid more transparent and responsive to today's quick-changing international challenges. Proposals have ranged from setting up advisory committees to a complete overhaul of foreign aid objectives and programs. This report presents the authorities of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and correlates those authorities with the operative appropriations measure (division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012; P.L. 112-74; 124 Stat. 786 at 1164) that funds those authorities. It replaces an earlier issue of the same report, dated July 29, 2011, to incorporate the current appropriations act. For many years, foreign aid appropriations measures have waived the requirement that funds must be authorized before they are appropriated and expended. Understanding the relation between the authorities in the cornerstone act and appropriations is key to foreign aid reform."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThroughout the first session of the 110 th Congress, the Senate considered four nominations to the six-seat FEC. Nominees Robert D. Lenhard (D), Hans A. von Spakovsky (R), and Steven T. Walther (D) served in recess appointments at the agency during that time and until their appointments expired at the end of the first session. The fourth nominee, David M. Mason (R), served at the agency since 1998 and was renominated (although his re-nomination was withdrawn in May 2008, as was von Spakovsky's). Throughout the first session of the 110 th Congress, the von Spakovsky nomination generated controversy. In particular, some Senators and others debated von Spakovsky's actions on voting rights issues while serving at the Justice Department. Much of a June 13, 2007, Senate Rules and Administration Committee hearing and subsequent markup focused on von Spakovsky. On September 26, 2007, after being unable to reach agreement on reporting the nominations individually, the committee reported all four nominees en bloc without recommendation. In the closing days of the first session, the Senate was unable to reach a compromise over the nominees, including whether they should be considered on the floor separately or as a group. The apparent stalemate over the nominations continued into the second session of the 110 th Congress. The Lenhard, Mason, von Spakovsky, and Walther nominations remained pending in the Senate early in the second session of the 110 th Congress, but because the three recess appointments expired at the end of the first session, just two commissioners—Mason (R) and Ellen L. Weintraub (D)—remained in office. Both were previously confirmed by the Senate and could continue serving in holdover status following expired terms. Few developments occurred in early 2008. However, additional nomination activity took place beginning in April. First, Lenhard requested that his nomination be withdrawn. Second, on May 6, 2008, President George W. Bush made three new nominations to the FEC and withdrew Mason's re-nomination. Donald F. McGahn II (R), an election lawyer, was nominated to the Mason seat. At the same time, the President withdrew Lenhard's name and nominated Cynthia L. Bauerly (D), a Senate staffer, to that seat. Caroline C. Hunter (R), then a member of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), was nominated to the FEC seat formerly held by Michael E. Toner. (Toner resigned from the Commission in 2007.) On May 16, 2008, von Spakovsky requested that his nomination be withdrawn. On May 22, 2008, following a hearing the previous day, the Senate Rules and Administration Committee favorably reported the Bauerly, Hunter, and McGahn nominations. Also on May 22, 2008, the White House announced the President's intention to nominate Matthew S. Petersen (R), a Senate staffer, to the seat formerly held by von Spakovsky. Walther's nomination also continued to remain pending. On June 24, 2008, the Senate confirmed Bauerly, Hunter, McGahn, Petersen, and Walther. The five new commissioners joined Ellen Weintraub, who continues to serve at the FEC in holdover status. FEC appointments issues remained quiet until April 2009, when the terms of Commissioners McGahn and Walther expired. They joined Commissioner Weintraub in holdover status. As Table 1 shows, even with three expired terms, six commissioners remain in office. (The FEC would not lose its policymaking quorum until fewer than four commissioners remained in office.) On May 1, 2009, President Obama announced his intention to nominate Service Employees International Union (SEIU) associate general counsel John J. Sullivan to the Commission. The Senate received the nomination on May 4. Sullivan would replace Commissioner Weintraub. Even a two-member Commission was not halted entirely. FECA does not appear to require a four-commissioner majority to permit the FEC to carry out basic information-gathering functions, such as requiring written reports, gathering evidence in enforcement cases, and authorizing subpoenas. With fewer than four commissioners, agency staff and remaining commissioners could also continue to provide general information, and to prepare for a repopulated Commission. Existing campaign law and regulations remained in effect. In addition, in December 2007, when the FEC still had five commissioners, the Commission voted to amend its rules of internal procedure to permit remaining commissioners to execute some duties. Revisions to the FEC's so-called \"Directive 10\" permit the Commission to continue meeting with fewer than four members to: approve general public information, such as educational guides; appoint certain staff; and approve other basic administrative and employment matters. FECA requires affirmative votes from at least four commissioners to: (1) make, amend, or repeal rules, (2) approve enforcement actions, (3) initiate, or defend itself in, certain court actions, (4) issue advisory opinions, (5) develop forms, (6) conduct hearings and investigations, and (7) refer cases of apparent criminal conduct to law enforcement. FECA also requires a minimum four-vote majority to administer at least some elements of the presidential public financing program, including certifying payments to eligible candidates. The Federal Election Commission was without a quorum of four commissioners for more than six months in 2008. Commission staff and the remaining two commissioners continued to provide information to the regulated community and to prepare for additional commissioners. In the interim, however, the absence of a quorum at the FEC delayed administering aspects of the presidential public financing program, rulemakings, and enforcement actions. Immediate issues facing the repopulated Commission included rulemaking to implement portions of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA), pending enforcement cases and advisory opinion requests, and administering the presidential public campaign financing program. The Commission also needed to respond to ongoing litigation surrounding the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. During 2009, the Commission continued to work through these and other issues that arose before, during, and after the shutdown. The loss of a policymaking quorum would not occur again unless fewer than four commissioners were in office. Nonetheless, the 2008 \"shutdown\" may continue to be of interest to the 111 th Congressional consideration of oversight or appropriations issues.", "completion": "response:\nThree recess appointments to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) expired at the end of the first session of the 110th Congress, leaving the agency with just two commissioners. Because the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) requires that at least four commissioners vote affirmatively to execute some of the agency's major functions, the FEC was unable to issue regulations, approve enforcement actions, and administer aspects of the presidential public campaign financing program. The Commission also could not issue advisory opinions. Existing campaign finance law and regulations remained in effect. Remaining commissioners and staff continued routine business. On June 24, 2008, the Senate confirmed five nominees to the FEC. Those five commissioners joined a sixth member who continued to serve in holdover status. Therefore, the Commission was restored to full decision-making strength. By the end of April 2009, the terms of three commissioners (total) had expired, but because commissioners may continue to serve in holdover status, six members remained in office. Examining the Commission's operating status and its backlog from 2008 may be an oversight or appropriations issue of interest to the 111th Congress. CRS Report R40091, Campaign Finance: Potential Legislative and Policy Issues for the 111th Congress, by [author name scrubbed], discusses other recent campaign finance developments, including FEC issues.) Although the loss of the Commission's policymaking quorum has now been resolved, this report will be updated occasionally to reflect subsequent developments."}

(1) Aliens who come tothe United States through the permanent legal immigration categories are commonly known as legal permanentresidents (LPRs). The fourth category of theemployment-based preference system is known as \"special immigrants,\" and the largest number of specialimmigrants are ministers of religion and religiousworkers. (2) Religious workers are treated separatelyfrom ministers of religion and are limited to 5,000 immigrants annually. Accompanying spouses and minorchildren of ministers of religion and religious workers are included as special immigrants. Prior to the Immigration Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-649 ), ministers of religion were admitted to the United States without numerical limits, and there was noseparate provision for religious workers. Religious workers immigrated through one of the more general categoriesof numerically-limited, employment-basedimmigration that were in effect at that time. The Immigration Act of 1990 amended the INA to redefine the specialimmigrant category to include ministers ofreligion and religious workers, but contained a \"sunset\"of the provision for religious workers on September 30,1994. It was subsequently extended severaltimes, most recently through September 30, 2003. (3) The 1990 Act also created a new nonimmigrant (i.e., temporary) visa for religious workers, commonlyreferred to as the R visa. (4) Defining what constitutes religious work is daunting given the theological diversity of religions, denominations, and faith traditions. The education, training,and ordination requirements for ministers of religion and religious workers vary greatly by religious group. Underthe special immigrant provisions, the INAdefines ministers of religion and religious workers as follows: (C) an immigrant, and the immigrant's spouse and children if accompanying or following to join the immigrant,who -- (i) for at least 2 years immediately preceding the time of application foradmission, has been a member of areligious denomination having a bona fide nonprofit, religious organization in the UnitedStates; (ii) seeks to enter the United States -- (I) solely for the purpose of carrying on the vocation of a minister of thatreligiousdenomination, (II) before October 1, 2003, in order to work for the organization at the requestof the organization in aprofessional capacity in a religious vocation or occupation, or (III) before October 1, 2003, in order to work for the organization (or a bona fide organization which is affiliatedwith the religious denomination and is exempt from taxation as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) ofthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986) at therequest of the organization in a religious vocation or occupation; and (iii) has been carrying on such a vocation, professional work, or other workcontinuously for at least the 2-yearperiod described in clause (i); (5) The regulations further define religious occupation as \"an activity which relates to a traditional religious function.\" (6) The nonimmigrant R visa category ofreligious workers holds to the same definitions; aliens on R visas are not, however, held to the 2-year experiencerequirement. Religious workers are notsubject to the labor certification requirements that many other employment-based immigrants must meet. (7) The INA is silent on what constitutes a religious denomination, but the regulations offer the following definition: Religious denomination means a religious group or community of believers having some form of ecclesiasticalgovernment, a creed or statement of faith, some form of worship, a formal or informal code of doctrine anddiscipline, religious services and ceremonies,established places of religious worship, religious congregations, or comparable indica of a bona fide religious denomination. For the purposes of this definition,an interdenominational religious organization which is exempt from taxation pursuant to �501(c)(3) of the InternalRevenue Code will be treated as a religiousdenomination. (8) The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Bureau in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the lead agency for immigrant admissions. (9) In the wider sweep of legal immigration to the United States, religious workers represent a tiny fraction of the annual flow -- 0.3% of the 1,063,732 immigrantsin FY2002. While the number of nonimmigrant R visas issued since FY1992 (first year the category was available)exceeds that of the permanent admissions,it likewise constitutes a small portion of all nonimmigrants admitted. The issuances of R visas has moved steadilyupward, but the levels of admission forpermanent religious workers has varied since FY1992 ( Figure 1 ). Most religious workers who become LPRs are not arriving from abroad; rather they are adjusting status after they have lived in the United States. In FY2002,only 389 of the 3,127 religious workers and their families arrived from abroad, while 87.6% adjusted to LPR statusas religious workers in the United States. Itis likely that most of those who adjusted status had entered on R visas as temporary religious workers. PDF version Bills ( H.R. 2152 / S. 1580 ) to extend the religious worker provision through September 30, 2008, have been introduced in bothchambers. Congressman Barney Frank introduced H.R. 2152 on May 19, 2003. The House JudiciaryCommittee ordered H.R. 2152 reported onSeptember 10, 2003, and the House passed H.R. 2152 on September 17, 2003. Senate Committee on theJudiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch introduceda bill similar to H.R. 2152, the Religious Worker Act of 2003 (S. 1580), on September 3, 2003. Although the extension of the religious worker provision has a broad base of support, efforts to make it a permanent immigration category have not succeeded. Some have criticized the religious worker provision as vulnerable to fraud. A few have expressed fear that it maybe an avenue for religious extremists to enterthe United States. Others, however, point out that the INA has provisions to guard against visa fraud and to excludefrom admission aliens who may threatenpublic safety or national security, and who commit fraud to enter the United States.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe benefits of greater educational attainment that accrue to individuals are both monetary (e.g., higher earnings) and nonmonetary (e.g., better health). The benefits of additional years of schooling extend beyond individuals and their families. These societal benefits also are of a pecuniary (e.g., greater economic growth) and nonpecuniary (e.g., increased civic involvement) nature. Partly because of the spillover of benefits from individuals to society, Congress has enacted measures to encourage more of the nation's population to enroll in postsecondary educational institutions (e.g., Pell Grants, education tax provisions). This report focuses specifically on differences over time in selected labor market outcomes of individuals associated with their educational attainment. Workers with more education historically have had higher annual earnings on average than workers with less education. In 2007, the latest year for which data are available, a worker with a bachelor's degree earned 2.66 times the amount earned by a worker who had not graduated from high school ($57,181 and $21,484, respectively). As also can be seen from the columns labeled \"current dollars\" in Table 1 , the importance of educational attainment to earnings has increased over the years. The wage premium of workers with a bachelor's degree compared to workers with some college courses or an associate degree grew by 13 percentage points from 51% on average in the first eight years of the 1980s to 64% on average in the first eight years of the 2000s. The payoff to graduating as opposed to not graduating from high school similarly increased by 14 percentage points from an average of 33% in the earlier period to 47% thus far in the current decade. The wage gap between workers with postsecondary education short of a four-year college degree and high school graduates also widened, but by 3 percentage points, from 10% on average in 1980-1987 to 13% in 2000-2007. All workers generally have seen their standard of living increase over the years, but their wages have been more insulated from rising prices the greater their educational attainment. The growth in earnings of individuals who did not graduate from high school just slightly outpaced the rise in the Consumer Price Index between 1987 and 2007, which would have increased their purchasing power by $839. The real (inflation-adjusted) value of wages paid to workers with a high school diploma or some college or associate degree held up much better against price increases over the 20-year period. They could have bought an additional $4,224 and $4,486, respectively, in goods and services. Bachelor's degree holders fared the best: the purchasing power of their 2007 paychecks was $11,477 greater than their 1987 paychecks. (See columns labeled \"2007 dollars\" in Table 1 .) The real average annual earnings of four-year college graduates have grown fairly steadily and very substantially over the years, while those of workers with a high school degree or less have fluctuated and not risen to as great a degree. This disparate pattern has sparked still ongoing concern about the extent of wage inequality in U.S. society. The annual earnings differences by level of education presented in Table 1 can be expected to produce even larger disparities after years spent in the labor force. According to a 2002 Census Bureau study, high school dropouts employed full-time year-round (i.e., at least 35 hours a week at least 50 weeks a year) over a 40-year working life might earn a total of $1.0 million in 1999 dollars. Similarly employed high school graduates might earn $1.2 million, and those with some college courses or an associate degree might earn $1.5-$1.6 million. College graduates employed full-time year-round throughout their working lives were estimated to earn considerably more, $2.1 million on average. As educational attainment increases, the likelihood of unemployment decreases. In 2008, for example, the unemployment rate of workers age 25 and older was 9.0% if they lacked a high school diploma, 5.7% if they were high school graduates, 4.6% if they took some postsecondary courses or obtained an associate degree, and 2.6% if they had at least a bachelor's degree. Unlike the previously examined increase over time in the educational wage premium, relative unemployment rates by educational attainment generally have been stable since 1978. The risk of displacement is lower and the likelihood of reemployment is higher for long-tenured workers with at least a bachelor's degree compared to other workers. Workers with a four-year college degree or more were laid off from long-held jobs at a below-average rate from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, while the displacement rate of workers with a high school diploma or less usually equaled the average rate. Workers with more years of schooling who were displaced from full-time jobs had a higher rate of reemployment in full-time jobs than displaced workers with fewer years of education. For example, 72% of workers with an advanced degree and 63% of workers with a bachelor's degree displaced from full-time jobs in the January 2003 to December 2005 period were reemployed in full-time jobs in January 2006; comparable reemployment rates were 57% among displaced high school graduates and 39% among displaced workers who did not enter or complete high school. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment in occupations typically requiring at least a bachelor's degree will increase by 15.3% between 2006 and 2016, well above the all-occupations average of 10.5%. The nearly five million new jobs estimated to be available to persons with at least a four-year college degree could account for almost one-third of all jobs projected to be added to the economy in the ten-year period. Many of the estimated five million new jobs are in professional occupations. Some professional specialties—computer software engineers (applications), computer systems analysts, and network systems and data communications analysts; elementary and postsecondary school teachers; and accountants and auditors—not only are projected to be among the fastest growing fields but also among those adding the largest number of positions through 2016. Occupations that usually require little or no postsecondary education are projected to grow at a comparatively slow rate, but these less skilled comparatively low-paying jobs (e.g., retail salespersons, food preparation and serving workers, general office clerks, home health aides) nonetheless rank among those estimated to experience the largest numerical increases in employment between 2006 and 2016.", "completion": "response:\nThe amount of education in which individuals invest greatly influences their labor market outcomes. For example, highly educated workers on average are better paid than other workers. Four-year college graduates also are less at risk of unemployment; if they should lose their jobs, these displaced workers are more likely than others to find new jobs. The importance of educational attainment to earnings levels has grown over time as well. Concern about the extent of wage inequality in U.S. society arose in part because of the comparatively large increases in real (inflation-adjusted) earnings of workers with at least a bachelor's degree."}

The statute permits states to make a claim for federal reimbursement of costs that are linked toproviding foster care to each federally eligible child. In FY2003, the most recent year for which dataare available, states sought federal reimbursement under this authority for approximately $4.5 billionin foster care costs. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), periodicallyconducts Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews to ensure that states are properly determiningthe eligibility of children for federal foster care support and are thus making correct claims forreimbursement. Federal eligibility for foster care is defined in Section 472 of the Social Security Act and isalso described in regulations. A child is eligible for federal foster care if (1) a judge has madecertain determinations regarding the necessity of his/her removal from the home, regarding thetimely efforts of the state child welfare agency to prevent the child's removal, and regarding timelyefforts to find a new permanent home for the child; (2) if (except for the removal from his or herhome) the child would have met the state's program requirements for the Aid to Families withDependent Children (AFDC) program (as that program existed on July 16, 1996); (3) the child isplaced in a licensed foster family home that is determined to be safe or in an otherwise eligiblelicensed care facility; and (4) the child is the care and placement responsibility of the state. Title IV-E eligibility reviews are designed primarily to improve program management in thefederal foster care program. A January 25, 2000 rule established the current form of the review andincludes certain checks that flow from the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act ( P.L. 105-89 ),which are intended to ensure both the safety of children in foster care and the timely actions of thestate child welfare agency to establish permanence for children. Since all aspects of the new rulebecame effective, HHS has conducted reviews in 43 states; of these, 16 were found not to besubstantially compliant with Title IV-E foster care eligibility rules. Requirements associated withjudicial determinations dominated as reasons for cases being found ineligible, making up 61% oferrors. Time limits for obtaining judicial determinations concerning permanency planning createda significant challenge for states. Safety and licensing disqualifications constituted 24% of errors. Problems were due mainly to lack of documentation to verify that state safety requirements weremet. Provisions related to AFDC eligibility made up 15% of all errors. About half of AFDC errorswere related to income rules, while the rest were linked to other program rules such as establishmentof \"deprivation.\" Only 1% of errors were a result of the responsibility and care of the child not beingvested with the state. This report provides an overview of the current Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviewprocess and a discussion of state performance on available reviews conducted after the January 25,2000 rule's effective date.

From 1940 to 2016, there were 21 lame duck sessions. The most recent la me duck session, which commenced on November 13, 2018, is not included in the data presented in this report. Of the 21 lame duck sessions examined, seven followed an election that switched the majority party in one or both chambers. That is, the party that controlled the House or Senate during the lame duck session did not retain its majority into the next Congress. Tab l e 1 displays these sessions, occurring in 1948, 1954, 1980, 1994, 2006, 2010, and 2014. Like the 2018 lame duck session, three lame duck sessions (1940 to 2016) followed a majority-changing midterm election during a President's first term of office. In each of these sessions (1954, 1994, 2010), the same party had controlled the White House, House, and Senate prior to the election. This report provides additional information on the 1954, 1994, and 2010 lame duck sessions. Lame duck sessions have been held for a variety of reasons. Their primary purpose is to complete action on legislation. They have also been used to prevent recess appointments and pocket vetoes, to consider motions of censure or impeachment, to keep Congress assembled on a standby basis, or to approve nominations (Senate only). In recent years, most lame duck sessions have focused on program authorizations, trade-related measures, appropriations, and the budget. Critics of lame duck sessions object to recently defeated Members or parties managing and acting on the legislative agenda. Proponents consider these post-election sessions to be useful for lawmaking at the end of a Congress. In the last two decades, lame duck sessions have become a routine occurrence during even-numbered years, regardless of which party is in the majority before the election. Prior to 1933, the last regular session of Congress was always a lame duck session. However, the 20 th Amendment to the Constitution changed the dates of the congressional term from beginning and ending on March 4 of odd-numbered years to January 3 of odd-numbered years. As a result, lame duck sessions are no longer an automatic feature of Congress. Today, lame duck sessions consist of any portion of a regular second session that falls after the November election in an even-numbered year and before the next Congress commences on January 3. Between 1935 and 1998, one or both houses held a lame duck session in 12 of the 32 Congresses (74 th -105 th ). In contrast, both houses held a lame duck session in every Congress from the 106 th through the 114 th (2000-2016). These sessions are now an anticipated—although not guaranteed—biennial event. In Congresses featuring a lame duck session, the preceding election break spanned an average of six to seven weeks and generally began by early to mid-October. During the break, the chambers either were in recess or held a series of pro forma sessions. Lame duck sessions begin once regular, consecutive daily sessions resume after an election break. Typically, sessions have started around the third week of November. Between 1935 and 2016, the average session length was about one calendar month. Within that time frame, the House held an average of 15 daily sessions, and the Senate held an average of 18 daily sessions. The shortest lame duck sessions featured a limited agenda. For instance, in 1998, the House spent three days considering the President Clinton impeachment proceedings. In 1948, the House and Senate met for one day, mainly to wrap up the 80 th Congress, and in 1994, the Members spent the two-day lame duck session considering a tariff and trade agreement. The 1948 and 1994 sessions took place after an election that switched the majority party. However, the other majority-change lame duck sessions were similar in length to the overall average. From 1935 to 2016, seven lame duck sessions followed an election that changed the majority party in one or both chambers of Congress. Two occurred during a presidential election year (1948, 1980), two followed a midterm election during the second term of a President (2006 and 2014), and three followed a midterm election during the first term of a President (1954, 1994, 2010). Tabl e 1 displays lame duck sessions that convened after an election that changed the majority party in either the House or the Senate. The table identifies the number of seats the majority party lost as well as the key measures approved during the post-election periods. In each of the lame duck sessions that followed a midterm election in a President's first term in office, the same party controlled the White House, the House, and the Senate. Below, more information is provided on the 1954 (Republican-controlled), 1994 (Democratic-controlled), and 2010 (Democratic-controlled) lame duck sessions of Congress. For a detailed review of lame duck sessions of Congress (1935-2016), see CRS Report R45154, Lame Duck Sessions of Congress, 1935-2016 (74th-114th Congresses) . In the 1954 midterm election, the Republican Party lost its majorities in both chambers during President Eisenhower's first term in office. After the election, the Senate reconvened solely to consider disciplinary actions against Republican Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. (The House remained adjourned for the remainder of the 83 rd Congress.) On November 9, a select investigative committee reported a resolution of censure, which was subsequently debated and amended on the Senate floor. On December 2, the Senate approved the two-count resolution censuring Senator McCarthy for behavior related to his inquiry into alleged communist influence in the federal government. Two years into President Clinton's presidency, the 1994 midterm gave Republicans control of the House and Senate for the next Congress. On November 29, both houses reconvened in order to consider the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The measure, which had stalled in the Senate prior to the election, received bipartisan support in the lame duck. The House passed the bill on the first day of the session, and the Senate passed it on December 1. In the 2010 election, midway through President Obama's first term in office, congressional Democrats lost their House majority as well as six seats in the Senate. On November 15, both chambers reconvened after the election to consider an extensive legislative agenda. Among the measures adopted, Congress passed the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (NDAA, P.L. 111-383 ), the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ( P.L. 111-353 ), the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act ( H.R. 2965 ), and the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act ( H.R. 847 ). The House and Senate also extended the 2001 and 2003 income tax cuts and adopted a series of continuing resolutions (CRs) to provide government funding through March 4, 2011. In addition, the Senate voted to approve ratification of an arms control treaty with Russia (New START) and confirmed 19 federal judges.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a broad civil rights statute prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities. As stated in the act, its purpose is \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\" Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination by public accommodations, which are defined to include movie theaters, but the statute does not include specific language on closed captioning or video description. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has promulgated regulations under Title III, but has not specifically addressed issues regarding closed captioning or video description. However, DOJ has issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to establish requirements for closed captioning and video description for movie theaters. In addition, the Ninth Circuit, in the first court of appeals case to address the issue, held that the ADA requires the provision of closed captioning and descriptive narration in movie theaters unless to do so would be a fundamental alteration or an undue burden. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination in \"the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\" Public accommodations are defined as including \"a motion picture house, theater, concert hall, stadium, or other place of exhibition entertainment.\" Places of public accommodation are prohibited from providing individuals with disabilities a service that is not equal to that afforded individuals without disabilities. In addition, public accommodations are required to take action to ensure that an individual with a disability is not excluded, denied services, or otherwise treated differently because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services \"unless the entity can demonstrate that taking such steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden.\" Auxiliary aids and services are defined as including \"qualified interpreters or other effective methods of making aurally delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments; [and] qualified readers, taped tests, or other effective methods of making visually delivered materials available to individuals with visual impairments.\" Although the ADA does not define \"undue burden,\" the DOJ regulations define undue burden as meaning \"significant difficulty or expense\" and provide various factors to be considered in making this determination. When the ADA was enacted in 1990, the technology for closed captioning was limited. The legislative history of the ADA did not specifically discuss closed captions, but did discuss open captioning. Open captioning was not seen as required by the ADA, but open captioned versions of films were encouraged and theaters were encouraged to have some preannounced screenings of open captioned films. The House Education and Labor Committee report also emphasized that advances in technology may change what the ADA requires: The Committee wishes to make it clear that technological advances can be expected to further enhance options for making meaningful and effective opportunities available to individuals with disabilities. Such advances may require public accommodations to provide auxiliary aids and services in the future which today would not be required because they would be held to impose undue burdens on such entities. On July 26, 2010, the 20 th anniversary of the enactment of the ADA, DOJ issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) regarding movie captioning and video description. DOJ examined the ADA's statutory language and found that \"given the present state of technology, we believe that requirements of captioning and video description fit comfortably within the statutory text.\" Although DOJ had raised some questions regarding closed captioning and video description in its 2008 notice of proposed rulemaking, no regulations on the subject were proposed, and none were included in the final rule. In the ANPR, DOJ sought further public comment on several new issues and technical questions as well as the implications of the conversion to digital cinema for potential regulations. The issues DOJ sought public comment on included the following: the implications of a sliding compliance schedule; the appropriate basis for calculating the number of movies that will be captioned and video described; whether movie theater owners and operators should be given the option to use open captioning; the number of movie theater owners or operators who have converted to digital cinema; whether there are specific protocols or standards for captioning and video description for digital cinema; whether DOJ should require a system of notifying individuals with disabilities in advance as to which movies provide captioning and video description; whether DOJ should consider a training requirement for movie theater personnel; and whether a proposed rule should be considered an economically significant regulatory act and, if so, are there alternative regulatory approaches to minimize such impact. The Ninth Circuit in Arizona v. Harkins Amusement Enterprise s became the first court of appeals to address the ADA's requirements concerning closed captioning and video descriptions. The court held that closed captioning and video descriptions may be required by the ADA, but are subject to the ADA's fundamental alteration and undue burden exceptions. Harkins involved a suit by two patrons of a theater, one with a hearing impairment and one with impaired vision. They alleged that the theater owners discriminated against them by not providing open or closed captioning and descriptive narration. The court examined the statutory language of the ADA, emphasizing the requirement for auxiliary aids and services and finding that \"movie captioning and audio descriptions clearly are auxiliary aids and services.\" Rejecting the defendant's argument that captioning and descriptive narration fall outside the scope of the ADA , the Ninth Circuit noted that the ADA makes it discriminatory to fail to take steps to ensure that an individual with a disability is not excluded \"because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services.\" The defendant also argued that DOJ's regulatory commentary specifically did not require open captioning, and the court agreed that the defendant should be able to rely on the plain meaning of DOJ's commentary until it was revised. However, the commentary did not address closed captioning, and the court returned to the statutory language regarding auxiliary aids for its analysis, finding that closed captioning and descriptive narration \"fall comfortably within the scope of this definition.\" In addition, the court noted that several defenses were available to the defendant, including the arguments that closed captioning and descriptive narration would fundamentally alter the nature of its services or constitute an undue burden. Although the Ninth Circuit's decision is only binding in that circuit, its decision provided an added impetus to DOJ's consideration of regulations in the area.", "completion": "response:\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a broad civil rights statute prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination by public accommodations, which are defined to include movie theaters, but the statute does not include specific language on closed captioning or video description. Although the Department of Justice (DOJ) has promulgated regulations under Title III, it has not specifically addressed issues regarding closed captioning or video description. However, DOJ has issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to establish requirements for closed captioning and video description for movie theaters. The ANPR asks for input in several areas including the implications of a sliding compliance schedule, and the appropriate basis for calculating the number of movies that will be captioned and video described. In addition, the Ninth Circuit, in the first federal court of appeals case to address the issue, held that the ADA requires the provision of closed captioning and descriptive narration in movie theaters unless to do so would be a fundamental alteration or an undue burden."}

The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration has jurisdiction over committee funding resolutions and issues regulations governing committee funding and staff. Committee funding and staff are also regulated by Senate rules, especially Rule XXVI, clause 9, and Rule XXVII, as well as by statute. The funds authorized and allocated by resolution are appropriated in legislative branch appropriations acts. Authorization of funding for Senate committees (except the Committee on Appropriations and Select Committee on Ethics) is governed by Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 9. In recent practice, during the first few months of a new Congress, each Senate committee (except Appropriations and Ethics) typically reports a two-year funding resolution providing for its expenses. These resolutions are then incorporated by the Committee on Rules and Administration into a single, omnibus committee funding resolution . Since the 106 th Congress, committee funding resolutions have divided funds among three calendar periods—from March 1 to September 30 of the first year of a Congress, from October 1 to September 30 of the following year, and from October 1 to end of the following February—to align with the fiscal calendar. This permits the Senate to identify the amounts authorized for each fiscal year and the subsequent appropriations required. On February 28, 2017, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent S.Res. 62 , authorizing expenditures by Senate committees for the period March 1, 2017, through September 30, 2017, the period October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2018, and for the period October 1, 2018, through February 28, 2019.

Appropriations for most programs authorized by the ESEA were authorized through FY2007. As Congress has not reauthorized the ESEA, appropriations for ESEA programs are currently not explicitly authorized. However, because the programs continue to receive annual appropriations, appropriations are considered implicitly authorized. During the 114 th Congress, the House Education and the Workforce Committee reported the Student Success Act ( H.R. 5 ), which would provide for a comprehensive reauthorization of the ESEA. The bill was subsequently passed on the House floor on July 8, 2015, based on a strictly partisan vote of 218-213. The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee reported the Every Child Achieves Act of 2015 (ECAA; S. 1177 ), which would also provide for a comprehensive reauthorization of the ESEA. S. 1177 was subsequently passed on the Senate floor on July 16, 2015, based on a bipartisan vote of 81-17. Both chambers agreed to a conference to resolve their differences. On November 19, 2015, the conference committee agreed to file the conference report of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) by a vote of 39-1. On December 2, 2015, the House agreed to the conference report based on a bipartisan vote of 359-64. This report highlights key provisions included in the ESSA and provides some context regarding the treatment of similar provisions in current law, where applicable. Table 1 highlights key provisions in the bill. An emphasis has been placed on issues that have received the most attention during the reauthorization process, including Title I-A accountability and formula issues and Title II-A formula issues. Table 2 depicts the proposed structure of the ESEA under the ESSA and includes all authorizations of appropriations for FY2017 through FY2020. The table also indicates whether a comparable program was included in current law. Table 3 provides examples of programs authorized under current law that would not be retained by the ESSA. The report does not aim to provide a comprehensive summary of ESSA or of technical changes that would be made by the bill. As Congress had not enacted legislation to reauthorize the ESEA, on September 23, 2011, President Obama and the Secretary of Education (hereinafter referred to as the Secretary) announced the availability of an ESEA flexibility package for states and described the principles that states must meet to obtain the included waivers. The waivers exempt states from various academic accountability requirements, teacher qualification-related requirements, and funding flexibility requirements that were enacted through NCLB. State educational agencies (SEAs) may also apply for optional waivers related to the 21 st Century Community Learning Centers program and the use of funds, determinations of adequate yearly progress (AYP), and the allocation of Title I-A funds to schools. However, in order to receive the waivers SEAs must agree to meet four principles established by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for \"improving student academic achievement and increasing the quality of instruction.\" The four principles, as stated by ED, are (1) college- and career-ready expectations for all students; (2) state-developed differentiated recognition, accountability, and support; (3) supporting effective instruction and leadership; and (4) reducing duplication and unnecessary burden. Taken collectively, the waivers and principles included in the ESEA flexibility package amount to a fundamental redesign by the Administration of many of the accountability and teacher-related requirements included in current law. As of December 2015, 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico had approved ESEA flexibility applications, and ED was reviewing applications from other states. The ESSA would terminate all waivers associated with the ESEA flexibility package on August 1, 2016. The remainder of this report focuses only on current law and does not compare the provisions in the ESSA with the provisions included in the ESEA flexibility package. Table 1 highlights similarities and differences between the ESSA and current law. As previously discussed, areas of the ESSA that have received the most congressional interest are given a more in-depth review in the table. The major areas considered include the following: overall structural and funding issues; Title I-A accountability; Title I-A formulas; teachers, principals, and school leaders; flexibility and choice; and general provisions. No attempts, however, were made to provide a comprehensive analysis of the ESSA. Table 2 depicts the structure of the ESSA by title. For each program with an authorization of appropriations, the amount authorized is provided for FY2017 through FY2020. The table also indicates whether the program is a new program or one that is similar to a program included in current law. An indication that a program is also included in current law does not mean that the program is being retained without changes. For example, while the ESSA would retain Title II-A, a state grant program focused on teachers, it would modify the formula used to award grants and the uses of funds. Table 3 provides examples of programs authorized under current law that would not be authorized under the ESSA. Activities supported by some of the programs that would no longer be authorized, however, may be required or allowable uses of funds under programs that would be authorized under the ESSA. For example, under the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants program (block grant program), LEAs could use funds to support counseling programs, create safe school environments, provide physical education, and support the use of technology; and states and LEAs could use funds to reimburse low-income students for the costs of accelerated learning examination fees, such as Advanced Placement (AP) exams. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all programs authorized under current law that would no longer be authorized. Rather, this list is based primarily on programs that have been included as line-items on appropriations tables in recent years and would not continue to be authorized by the ESSA.", "completion": "response:\nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was last comprehensively amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB; P.L. 107-110).

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nPresident Obama's FY2014 budget request for Energy and Water Development was released in April 2013. The request totaled $34.9 billion. The Energy and Water Development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the Department of the Interior's Central Utah Project (CUP) and Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), the Department of Energy (DOE), and a number of independent agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). FY2013 discretionary appropriations were considered in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ), which established discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. The BCA also tasked a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan for Congress and the President to enact by January 15, 2012. Because deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by that date, an automatic spending reduction process established by the BCA was triggered; this process consists of a combination of sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, initially scheduled to begin on January 2, 2013. The \"joint committee\" sequestration process for FY2013 requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding at a percentage to be determined, under terms specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA, Title II of P.L. 99-177 , 2 U.S.C. 900-922), as amended by the BCA. For further information on the Budget Control Act, see CRS Report R41965, The Budget Control Act of 2011 , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed]. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA, P.L. 112-240 ), enacted on January 2, 2013, made a number of significant changes to the procedures in the BCA that will take place during FY2013. First, the date for the joint committee sequester to be implemented was delayed for two months, until March 1, 2013. Second, the dollar amount of the joint committee sequester was reduced by $24 billion. Third, the statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 and FY2014 were lowered. For further information on the changes to BCA procedures made by ATRA, see CRS Report R42949, The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012: Modifications to the Budget Enforcement Procedures in the Budget Control Act , by [author name scrubbed] Pursuant to the BCA, as amended by ATRA, President Obama ordered that the joint committee sequester be implemented on March 1, 2013. The accompanying OMB report indicated a dollar amount of budget authority to be canceled to each account containing non-exempt funds. The sequester will ultimately be applied at the program, project, and activity (PPA) level within each account. Because the sequester was implemented at the time that a temporary continuing resolution was in force, the reductions were calculated on an annualized basis and will be apportioned throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Although full year FY2013 funding has been enacted, the effect of these reductions on the budgetary resources that will ultimately be available to an agency at either the account or PPA level remains unclear until further guidance is provided by OMB as to how these reductions should be applied. Table 1 includes budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for FY2007 to FY2014. Table 2 lists totals for each of the bill's four titles. The following tables present the requested FY2014 funding for the major programs included in the Energy and Water Development appropriations bills. Because of the uncertainty involved in the sequestration of FY2013 funding, the requested amounts are compared to the funding appropriated for FY2012. The present report is a preliminary survey of the proposed FY2014 Energy and Water Development appropriations. A more comprehensive report on the FY2014 appropriation will follow. For a detailed description of these programs, see the CRS Report R42498, Energy and Water Development: FY2013 Appropriations .

On March 26, 2013, the President signed H.R. 933, the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction, and Veterans Affairs, Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-6). The act funds Energy and Water Development accounts at the FY2012 enacted level for the rest of FY2013, with some exceptions. However, under BCA, an automatic spending reduction process, consisting of a combination of sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, went into effect March 1, 2013. The effect of these reductions on the budgetary resources that will ultimately be available to an agency at the account level remains unclear until further guidance is provided by OMB as to how these reductions should be applied. President Obama's FY2014 budget request for Energy and Water Development was released in April 2013. For FY2014, as in previous years, the level of overall spending will be a major issue. On March 21, 2013, the House passed H.Con.Res. 25, setting FY2014 spending at $2.77 trillion. On March 23, the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 8, with a spending level for FY2014 of $2.96 trillion. Allocations for individual appropriations bills have not yet been set by the Appropriations Committees. In addition to overall funding levels, issues specific to Energy and Water Development programs include the distribution of appropriations for Corps (Title I) and Reclamation (Title II) projects that have historically received congressional appropriations above Administration requests; alternatives to the proposed national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, which the Administration has abandoned (Title III: Nuclear Waste Disposal); and proposed FY2014 spending levels for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) programs (Title III) that are more than 50% higher in the Administration's request than the amount appropriated for FY2012.

The requirements are detailed, especially when the regulatory interpretations areconsidered. The majorprinciples include requiring that: States and school districts make available a free appropriate public education (FAPE) (3) to all children withdisabilities, generally between the ages of 3 and 21; states and school districts identify, locate, andevaluate all children withdisabilities, regardless of the severity of their disability, to determine which children are eligible for specialeducation and relatedservices; Each child receiving services has an individual education program (IEP) delineatingthe specific specialeducation and related services to be provided to meet his or her needs; the parent must be a partner in planning andoverseeing thechild's special education and related services as a member of the IEP team ; \"To the maximum extent appropriate,\" children with disabilities must be educated withchildren who are notdisabled ; and states and school districts must provide procedural safeguards to childrenwith disabilities and their parents, includinga right to a due process hearing, the right to appeal to federal district court and, in some cases, the right to receiveattorneys'fees. Although paperwork (4) is required to implement many of these statutory provisions, the area that has attracted the most discussionregarding paperwork is that relating to the IEP. The IEP is described by the Department of Education (ED) as the\"cornerstone of aquality education of each child with a disability.\" (5) It \"creates an opportunity for teachers, parents, school administrators, relatedservices personnel, and students (when appropriate) to work together to improve educational results for childrenwith disabilities.\" (6) Once a child is identified as a child with a disability, an IEP meeting is scheduled to discuss the child's needs andwrite an IEP. School staff are required to contact the participants, including the parents, and to provide the parents with certaininformationincluding the purpose, time and location of the meeting, and who will be attending. The IEP must contain certaininformation: how the child is currently performing in school (usually gleaned from evaluation of tests); (7) annual goals; (8) the special education and related services to be provided to the child, and the extent (if any) to whichthe childwill not participate with children without disabilities in the regular classroom; (9) any modifications in state or district wide testing; (10) when services will begin, how often they will be provided and how long they will last; (11) beginning at age 14 the IEP must address the courses the child needs to take to reach his or herpost-schoolgoals; (12) what transition services are necessary; (13) changes in rights at the age of majority; (14) and how the child's progress is to be measured and how the parents are to be informed of theprogress. (15) The IEP team may also need to consider certain special facts such as behavior management strategies, needs related to limited Englishproficiency, communication needs, needs for braille materials, and needs for assistive technology devices orservices. (16) Although some teachers have noted that the IEP requirements may necessitate a voluminous IEP, (17) the Department of Education'ssample IEP form is five pages. (18) The Departmenthas also responded to an inquiry regarding the paperwork requirements of IDEAnoting that it is \"constantly reviewing its regulations to ensure that paperwork burdens on States and local schooldistricts areminimized.\" (19) State educational agencies are alsorequired to review their state requirements to minimize paperwork. ED also notedthat the IDEA Amendments of 1997 reduced paperwork in several ways by, for example, permitting initialevaluations andrevaluations to be based on existing evaluation data and reports. (20) The most recent data on paperwork is a study by Westat for the U.S. Department of Education (ED). (21) This study, which was basedon a nationally representative telephone survey of special education teachers, found that \"53 percent of elementaryand secondaryspecial education teachers reported that routine duties and paperwork interfered with their job of teaching to a great extent \" and theseteachers \"typically spend over 10 percent of their time [5 hours per week] completing forms and doingadministrative paperwork.\" (22) Among the most time consuming activities were completing and revising the individualized education program(IEP) (on average, 2hours are spent on each IEP) and IEP meetings (on average, each meeting takes 1� hours). (23) Although only 35% of specialeducation teachers conduct evaluations of children with disabilities, those who do spend nearly 12 hours per monthconductingassessments and reviewing assessment information. (24) Both the House and Senate committee reports (25) accompanying their respective bills note that reducing paperwork is an important aimof the legislation. In its concluding remarks on the bill, the House report states that the bill centers on the\"Committee's principles forreform,\" which among other things includes reducing paperwork. (26) The Senate report notes that one of the ways S. 1248 would improve IDEA is to \"reduce bureaucratic paperwork for teachers.\" (27) More specifically, both reports point to provisionsin their respective bills aimed at reducing paperwork and administrative burden. The following are some examplescited in thereports: Both bills would require the General Account Office (GAO) to study and report on special education paperwork( H.R. 1350 Section 104 and S. 1248 Section 609). Both bills change the general eligibility provision for states (Sec. 612(a)) and local educational agencies(LEAs)(Sec. 613(a)) to require states and LEAs to \"reasonably demonstrate\" (House bill) or \"provide assurances\" (Senatebill) that requiredpolicies and procedures are in effect. (28) Both bills would permit states to use IDEA Part B grants-to-state funds for paperwork reductionactivities,including the use of technology ( H.R. 1350 Section 611(e)(4)(F) and S. 1248 Section611(e)(2)(C)(ii)). Both bills would permit local educational agencies (LEAs) to use Part B funds for technology relatedto casemanagement activities, such as record keeping and data collection ( H.R. 1350 Section 613(a)(4)(D) and S. 1248 Section 613(a)(4)(B)). (29) Both bills would eliminate school-based improvement plans (Section 613(g) in currentlaw). (30) Both bills would eliminate the requirement that IEPs contain benchmarks or short-term goals (Sec.614(d)(1)(A)(ii) of current law). (31) Both bills include language to prevent the addition of requirements for information in the IEP that arenotexplicitly required in Section 614 (Section 614(d)(1)(A)(ii) in both bills). Both bills would permit multi-year IEPs, although the Senate bill limits these IEPs to children withdisabilitieswho are 18 years of age or older (Section 614(d)(5) in both bills).

Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Minerals Management Service (MMS) manage federal onshore and offshore oil and gas leases, respectively. Acquiring a federal lease gives the lessee the rights to explore for and develop the oil and gas resources under the lease, including drilling wells and building pipelines that may lead to oil and gas production. This statement focuses on findings from a number of recent GAO reports on federal oil and gas management. GAO has made numerous recommendations to Interior, which the agency generally agreed with and is taking steps to address. However, two important issues remain unresolved. Specifically, GAO made one recommendation and one matter for Congressional consideration that together call for a comprehensive reevaluation of how Interior manages federal oil and gas resources. Interior has not undertaken such a comprehensive review and until this is done, the public cannot have reasonable assurance that federal oil and gas resources are being appropriately managed for the public good. In recent years, GAO has conducted numerous evaluations of federal oil and gas management and found many material weaknesses. Specifically: In September 2008, we reported that (1) Neither BLM nor MMS were meeting statutory obligations or agency targets for conducting inspections of certain leases and metering equipment used to measure oil and gas production. (2) MMS's royalty IT system and processes lacked several important capabilities, including monitoring adjustments made by companies to their self-reported production and royalty data and identifying missing royalty reports in a timely manner. (3) MMS's use of compliance reviews, which are more limited in scope than audits, led to an inconsistent use of third-party documents to verify that self-reported industry data are correct. (4) MMS's annual reports to the Congress did not fully describe the performance of the royalty-in-kind program and, in some instances, may have overstated the benefits of the program. (5) The federal government receives one of the lowest shares of revenue for oil and gas resources compared with other countries and Interior has not systematically re-examined how the federal government is compensated for extraction of oil and gas for over 25 years. In October 2008, we reported that (1) Some states do more than Interior to structure leases to reflect the likelihood of oil and gas production, which may encourage faster development. In June 2005, we reported that (1) BLM has encountered persistent problems in hiring and retaining sufficient and adequately trained staff to keep up with workload as a result of rapid increases in oil and gas operations on federal lands and poor workforce planning. In recent reports, GAO has made a number of recommendations to improve the accuracy of royalty measurement and collections and the overall management of federal oil and gas resources. Interior generally agreed with our recommendations and is trying to implement them but implementation is ongoing and it is too early to assess the effectiveness these efforts."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe potential outcome of the resignation of long-time Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is unknown and any ramifications for the oil and natural gas sectors are uncertain. This paper examines the impact of a disruption of Egypt's oil and natural gas sector or a complete halt to exports of either oil or natural gas and closure of the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean (SUMED) oil pipeline, and the impact of those actions on world oil and natural gas markets. It is important to keep in mind that even the most nationalistic, isolationist, or anti-Western government would most likely not undertake all these measures. Oil, natural gas, and transit generate large amounts of revenue for Egypt and taking these measures could precipitate outside intervention, particularly closing the Suez Canal. Additionally, the timing of these actions would also change the impact on oil and natural gas markets, i.e., whether they occurred during the summer driving season or the winter heating season. An additional factor mitigating the impact on world oil and natural gas markets is that in 2009, Egypt consumed much of the energy it produced and had to import coal, highlighting the limited importance of Egypt as a global energy producer; see Figure 2 . Closing the Suez Canal would be one of the most visible actions a new government could take, particularly for the oil and natural gas industry. Although it would probably take only several weeks to re-route and re-size oil and natural gas tankers along with a possible drawdown of inventories, a closure of the canal would cause an immediate and most likely short-lived rise in global oil prices. Despite there being adequate spare production capacity in the world, oil prices tend to react quickly to market disruptions before settling back to their pre-existing price range. However, if the canal remained closed indefinitely, shipping costs would likely increase, adding upward pressure on oil prices. The same would likely be true for liquefied natural gas (LNG), but the effect would be less. Most LNG is sold under long-term contract, and there is currently a glut of LNG around the world to make up for any disruption. In 2009, an estimated 1.8 million barrels per day of oil (Mb/d) (of the world's roughly 80 Mb/d of production) moved through the canal—almost 1 Mb/d northbound and 0.85 Mb/d southbound. This is down from 2.4 Mb/d in 2008. The decline is mostly attributed to lower global demand for oil; production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), particularly from the Persian Gulf producing countries; and piracy. More oil is also flowing to Asia from the Middle East, while more West African oil is going to Europe and North America, and does not have to traverse the canal. 2010 data shows an increase in cargos, but is incomplete for the year. The last time the canal was closed, in 1967 until 1975, approximately 60% of Europe's oil supplies had been passing through the canal. Currently, only about 15% is shipped through the canal. Similar to the decrease in cargos through the canal, the SUMED oil pipeline—which is owned through state companies by Egypt (50%), Saudi Arabia (15%), the United Arab Emirates (15%), Kuwait (15%), and Qatar (5%)—is operating below its capacity of 2.5 Mb/d. In 2009, approximately 1.1 Mb/d moved through the pipeline, a decrease of about 50% compared to 2008. The reduction resulted from many of the same causes as the canal's drop-off in oil transportation. In 2009, 331 billion cubic feet (bcf) of LNG traversed the canal, which represents 4% of global LNG trade and less than 1% of natural gas consumed globally. Unlike oil, LNG cargos through the Suez Canal have been steadily rising. Between 2008 and 2009, the volume of LNG passing through the Suez Canal increased over 40%, more than doubling northbound cargos. Data for the first 10 months of 2010 show a 66% increase in LNG shipments through the canal compared to the 2009 total. The rise in LNG cargos is mostly attributable to the large increase in Qatar LNG exports. Nevertheless, there is ample supply of LNG in the global market, and rerouting LNG cargos to demand centers could be accomplished in a relatively short time frame. While Egypt is a relatively small player in the global natural gas industry, it can have a larger impact on regional natural gas supply. Egypt produces all the natural gas consumed in Lebanon, almost all the natural gas consumed in Jordan, and more than half the natural gas consumed in Israel. On a world scale, Egypt accounted for only 2.1% of global natural gas production and 2.1% of global natural gas trade in 2009. Egypt holds 77 trillion cubic feet or 1.2% of the world's proved gas reserves. Egypt exports natural gas through two pipelines and two LNG facilities. Currently, the Arab Gas Pipeline connects Egypt to Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. There are plans to expand the pipeline further, enabling Egypt to export natural gas through Turkey to Europe. In 2008, Egypt opened an export pipeline to Israel. There was an explosion in early February that shut down both pipelines for a short time although the damage was primarily to the Arab Gas Pipeline. Egypt has almost 600 bcf of LNG export capacity, with one facility in Damietta and one in Idku. Egypt accounted for approximately 5% of global LNG trade last year, with most cargos going to Europe. At the end of April 2011 the natural gas terminal near El-Arish in Egypt (see Figure 1 above) was attacked for the second time since protests erupted in that country in January. Natural gas from the terminal supplies the Arab Gas Pipeline to Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, and a separate pipeline to Israel. There is no estimate for how long natural gas will not be exported. The pipeline was also attacked and disabled in February causing natural gas supplies to be stopped for about a month. The terminal has been a target for Bedouins who feel neglected and oppressed by Cairo. Aside from its role as a transit center, withdrawal of Egypt's own oil production from the global market would likely have limited impact on world oil prices. In 2010, Egypt was a small net importer of oil, producing approximately 0.66 Mb/d while consuming close to 0.71 Mb/d. Egypt's oil production has been in decline since the early 1990s, a trend not likely to be reversed. The country—which has the largest refining capacity in Africa, with 975,000 barrels of processing capacity—did export some refined products, such as naptha, but imported others. Cutting off exports of naptha, an oil product that can be used in making petrochemicals and gasoline, could put minor upward pressure on European prices, which is a main market for Egyptian exports. Global oil prices have already reacted to the unrest in Egypt despite no disruption to Egyptian production. The reaction comes from two concerns: (1) the near-term risk that any disruption to oil transit through Egypt could delay oil shipments for several weeks (as they are rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope, adding extra shipping time) and (2) the more significant concern that political unrest could spread to other, more important energy exporters in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, or Kuwait. There has been some upward pressure on natural gas prices as companies scramble to hedge against a disruption of Egyptian exports, but the benchmark natural gas price in the United Kingdom is actually down. Should the scenario described above come to pass, there would likely be little impact on the global oil and natural gas market in the long term. Both industries will take some time to recalibrate flows, but should be able to accomplish that with minor or no disruptions. Additionally, the strategic petroleum reserves of member countries of the International Energy Agency, which are mostly from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), could also be utilized to bridge any gap in oil flows should a disruption prove to be significant.", "completion": "response:\nThe change in Egypt's government will likely not have a significant direct impact on the global oil and natural gas markets. There may be some short-term movements in price, mostly caused by perceived instability in the marketplace, but these would most likely be temporary. However, prolonged instability that raises the specter of spreading to other oil and natural gas producers in the region would likely add to upward price pressures. Although Egypt is considered an energy producer or net exporter overall, its oil and natural gas exports are not large enough to affect regional or global prices. The most serious impact would be on regional recipients of its natural gas exports. Egypt's main influence on energy markets is its control of the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean oil pipeline (SUMED). The current low utilization of these two pieces of infrastructure would likely limit any effect of their closure in the near term. Both the oil and natural gas industry would, over time, find alternative routes to circumvent the canal and pipeline if necessary."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe TANF block grant is a fixed amount of funding paid to each state based on a formula. States design and administer benefits and services funded by TANF and have wide latitude in their use of block grant funds. States are required to share a portion of the cost of TANF benefits and services by expending some of their own funds on TANF-related benefits and services through a \"maintenance of effort\" requirement. TANF is the major federal-state program providing cash assistance to needy families with children. While federal TANF grants help fund this cash assistance, states determine eligibility rules and benefit amounts which vary greatly among the states. There are no federal rules regarding eligibility and benefits for ongoing cash welfare, other than the requirement that it be paid to families with children that meet a financial test of economic need. Table 1 provides some basic information on cash welfare benefits in the states affected by Hurricane Katrina and some of their neighboring states. It shows both the maximum monthly benefit amount paid to a family of three as of January 2005 and the average number of families that received cash assistance in June 2006. The maximum monthly benefit is generally the amount paid to a family with no other income sources. TANF cash assistance benefits in this region are relatively low compared with those paid in other regions and states. For example, the comparable maximum cash welfare grant paid in New York City in January 2005 was $691 per month and the maximum cash welfare grant paid to a family of three in the urban areas of California was $723 per month. TANF imposes some requirements on states with respect to families receiving cash assistance. The purpose of the requirements is to ensure that receipt of cash welfare is temporary and to encourage movement off the rolls and into work. TANF requires that a specified percentage of its caseload be engaged in work or job preparation activities, limits federally-funded assistance to five years, and requires that cash assistance recipients cooperate with child support enforcement rules (establish paternity and assign child support to the state). TANF also gives authority to states to pay \"emergency assistance\" benefits. Emergency benefits are those that: are considered \"nonrecurrent, short-term benefits;\" are designed to deal with a specific crisis situation or episode of need; are not intended to meet recurrent or ongoing needs; and will not extend beyond four months. Families receiving such emergency benefits are not subject to the same requirements (i.e, work requirements and time limits) as are families that receive cash assistance. As with cash welfare, states determine eligibility for and the scope of emergency benefits provided to low-income families with children. In addition to ongoing cash welfare and emergency aid, TANF can fund a wide range of other social services for low-income families with children, such as child care, transportation aid, family preservation and support services, and similar types of services. As with ongoing cash welfare and emergency assistance, states determine eligibility and the scope of benefits provided to needy families with children. Welfare programs are not usually associated with responses to natural disasters. However, the scope of Hurricane Katrina's displacement of families, the strain placed on human service agencies responding to this displacement, plus the flexibility allowed states to design programs under TANF, made the block grant a potential source of help to the victims of this disaster. While TANF funding is flexible and provides states with options to help needy families, the legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President addressed some policy considerations. TANF block grants are fixed amounts determined by formula in federal law, and absent federal legislation benefits paid by a host state to evacuees would come from that host state's TANF allocation. P.L. 109-68 allowed states to draw from the TANF contingency fund to provide 100% federal funding for certain benefits paid to families that evacuated hurricane-damaged areas. Funding was capped at 20% per year of the host state's annual block grant. In FY2006, a total of $48.4 million was drawn from the TANF contingency fund to provide short-term benefits for evacuees. Table 2 shows TANF contingency fund grants for evacuees of hurricane-damaged areas. The fixed TANF block grants do not adjust for changes in the circumstances of a state. Though TANF did contemplate extra funding in the case of a recession, it has no mechanism to increase funding in the event of a natural disaster. P.L. 109-68 provided extra funding for FY2005 and FY2006 for the three hurricane-damaged states of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, an extra 20% of the damaged state's block grant. TANF recipients who receive ongoing cash assistance are subject to certain requirements, such as time limits and work requirements. For FY2005 and FY2006, P.L. 109-68 waived penalties on the states for failure to meet state work requirements as well as the penalty for having more than 20% of its caseload on the rolls for more than five years (the TANF time limit). It also gives the authority to states to provide short-term, nonrecurring benefits for evacuee families receiving benefits in other states and families in hurricane damaged states, to meet subsistence needs and not have that time count for purposes of work requirements or time limits.", "completion": "response:\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides grants to states to help them fund a wide variety of benefits and services to low-income families with children.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe sheer number of children coming to the United States who are not accompanied by parents or legal guardians has raised considerable concern. Overwhelmingly, the children are coming from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. This report focuses on the demographics of unaccompanied alien children while they are in removal proceedings. It discusses the characteristics of these children by nationality, age, and sex and explores these trends over the past few years. It further builds on a set of Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports examining the issues surrounding unaccompanied alien children. After Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have apprehended and processed an unaccompanied alien child, DHS transfers the child into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). ORR is responsible for placing unaccompanied alien children in appropriate care. The law requires that ORR ensure that the interests of the child are considered in decisions and actions relating to the care and custody of an unaccompanied child. ORR also oversees the infrastructure and personnel of residential facilities for unaccompanied alien children, among other responsibilities. ORR arranges to house the unaccompanied child either in one of its shelters or in a foster care arrangement, or it reunites the unaccompanied child with a family member. In this report, the demographic and placement trends of unaccompanied children are based upon summary data extracted from case file data that ORR maintains on unaccompanied alien children. Due to the confidential nature of ORR data generally, CRS used only selected variables for this analysis. The summary data span the period between FY2011 and FY2014. The FY2014 data are partial (available through April 30, 2014), which made it difficult to reach conclusions about patterns or trends when comparing to the other three fiscal years. Much attention has been focused on the top countries of origin for the unaccompanied children. Over the past four years, ORR had unaccompanied children in its custody from 87 different countries, ranging from 41 to 50 different countries each fiscal year. Nevertheless, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have consistently accounted for the overwhelming majority of all unaccompanied children in ORR custody ( Table 1 ). While the most notable increase in unaccompanied children over the past three fiscal years and the first seven months of FY2014 was from Honduras (980%)—as it steadily increased in overall rank from fourth in FY2011 to first through the first seven months of FY2014—even the smallest increase in unaccompanied children in ORR custody of the three countries (El Salvador) was notable: 463% from FY2011 through the first seven months of FY2014 ( Figure 1 ). Not all apprehended unaccompanied children are transferred to ORR, as some are voluntarily returned to their home countries. Although Mexican children generally make up a sizeable number of the unaccompanied alien children apprehended by CBP officers, only a portion of them end up in ORR custody. For example, CBP apprehended 11,577 Mexican unaccompanied children in the first eight months of FY2014, and only 494 Mexican unaccompanied children were placed in ORR custody during the first seven months of FY2014. Age is a key factor to qualify as an unaccompanied alien child under the law. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 defines an unaccompanied alien child as an individual who has no lawful immigration status in the United States, has not yet reached the age of 18, and has no parent or legal guardian in the United States or no parent or legal guardian in the United States who is available to provide care and physical custody. Those 18 and older in ORR custody could have entered the United States shortly before turning 18, could be awaiting transfer back to DHS custody, or could have special needs that have kept them in ORR custody past the age of 18. The median age of unaccompanied children in ORR custody was 17 years old in FY2011 and FY2012, as Table 2 presents. The median age fell to 16 years old in FY2013 and has remained there in the first seven months of FY2014. The youngest three age groups (0-9, 10-12, and 13-15 years old) experienced the most percentage growth compared to the oldest three age groups (16-17, 18, and 19+ years old), which have experienced a percentage decrease during the period examined ( Figure 2 ). While there continued to be a greater overall number of older children in ORR custody, there was also a noteworthy increase in younger children in ORR custody, particularly in the 10-12 age group ( Figure 2 ) over the period studied. From October 1, 2010, through April 30, 2014, ORR had a total of 8,879 unaccompanied children under the age of 13 in its custody. From FY2011 through the first seven months of FY2014, there was an increase in the number of children in each of the three youngest age brackets (0-9, 10-12, and 13-15) for Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Most notably, in the first seven months of FY2014, the youngest three age brackets for Honduras made up over half of all Honduran unaccompanied children (6,242). Like Honduras and El Salvador, Guatemala had an increase in the three youngest age brackets, however, it also had the greatest number of unaccompanied children in the oldest three age brackets (16-17, 18, and 19+) ( Figure 3 ). Traditionally there have been more male than female unaccompanied children in ORR custody. In 2002, immigration officials testified that the overwhelming majority of unaccompanied alien children were male. The number of unaccompanied females increased from 1,075 in FY2011 to 5,385 in FY2013. The number of unaccompanied girls reached 2,959 in the first seven months of FY2014. Similarly, the percentage of females among unaccompanied children has grown. The share of females was stable at about 22% in FY2011 and FY2012 and increased to about 27% in FY2013 and 33% in the first seven months of FY2014 ( Figure 4 ). As previously shown in Figure 1 , the overwhelming majority of unaccompanied children in ORR custody from FY2011 through the first seven months of FY2014 originated from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The sex distribution from the top countries of origin among children in ORR custody was examined to provide a better understanding of the female population. Examining the male-to-female ratio for each specific top source country reveals that a greater proportion of females in ORR custody originated from El Salvador than from Honduras, while a lower proportion of females originated from Guatemala ( Figure 5 ). Honduras had the most females in ORR custody and was also the country with the greatest number of minors in ORR custody overall. In absolute numbers, most males in ORR custody were ages 16-17 in each of the three fiscal years and in the first seven months of FY2014; however, the number of males age 0-9, 10-12, and 13-15 steadily increased over the past three fiscal years and in the first seven months of FY2014 ( Figure 6 ). Similar patterns occurred for females. In the first seven months of FY2014, the number of females in the 16-17 age bracket increased, whereas the number of males decreased ( Figure 7 ). The median age of unaccompanied children by year, sex, and top country ( Table 3 ) present the age trends a bit more starkly. The median age of females has dropped from 17 years in FY2011—the year that was the median age across all groups of children—to 15 years in the first seven months of FY2014. The median age for females in FY2013 was 13 years. When viewed by country, the median age decreased for all three and fell to 15 years for Honduran children during the first seven months of FY2014.", "completion": "response:\nThe number of children coming to the United States who are not accompanied by parents or legal guardians and who lack proper immigration documents has raised complex and competing sets of humanitarian concerns and immigration control issues.

The median age of unaccompanied children has decreased from 17 years in FY2011 to 16 years during the first seven months of FY2014. A greater share of males than females are represented among this population. However, females have steadily increased in total numbers and as a percentage of the flow since FY2011. The median age of females has dropped from 17 years in FY2011—the year that was the median age across all groups of children—to 15 years in the first seven months of FY2014."}

The adjustments are determined by the change inthe private sector element of the EmploymentCost Index (ECI) from September to September. The percentage of change, minus 0.5%, becomes the scheduledrate of adjustment. For January 2004, the rateof adjustment was scheduled at 2.7%. Locality-based payments are determined separately, based on wage surveydata from 32 geographicareas. Under 5 U.S.C. 5303 and 5 U.S.C. 5304, President George W. Bush sent forward an alternative plan in August 2003 that called for a 1.5%increase in General Schedule, and related systems, basic pay and an average of 0.5% in locality-based payments forJanuary 2004. Barring any action by Congress to establish a different rate or effective date, the President's alternative plan willgovern. Both the House and Senate voted to establish a 4.1% pay adjustment, effective January 2004. (2) With passage of the 4.1%, the basic pay adjustment will be the scheduled ECI adjustment of 2.7% and the locality pay adjustment willaverage 1.4%.

The scheduled January 2004 pay adjustment, based on the ECI, is 2.2%. Section 704, as amended, stipulates that officials' pay adjustments cannot exceed the rate of adjustment for GS basicpay. P.L. 108-167 , as required under Section 140, P.L. 97-92 , permits the judges to receive the annual adjustment. GS pay adjustment in January 2004, pending presidential approval of the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act, is limited to 1.5% forbasic pay and an average of 0.5% for locality.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nSince 1988, Congress has passed several laws concerning television reception via satellite: the 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA, P.L. 100-667 ), amendments to the act in 1994, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 (SHVIA, P.L. 106-113 ) , and the most recent law, the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA). SHVERA was passed as Division J of Title IX of the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( H.R. 4818 , P.L. 108-447 ) in December 2004. A number of changes were made to provisions affecting consumers who receive analog \"distant network signals\" and \"local-into-local\" network signals. Three factors are important in understanding the eligibility criteria for these different signals: signal strength, distant and local signals, and unserved households. Signal strength can be visualized as two concentric circles around a TV station's transmitter. Points in the inner circle close to the transmitter can receive a strong, \"Grade A\" television broadcast signal, via an over-the-air antenna (rooftop or \"rabbit ears\"). Points in the outer circle can receive a weaker, \"Grade B\" signal. Beyond the outer circle, where no signal can be received, are \"white areas.\" Over-the-air signal strength is the guiding factor in determining which households are eligible to receive distant network signals via satellite. A network broadcast signal is one received by a household located within a network television affiliate's local area. When retransmitted by satellite back into the same local area, such signals are called \"local-into-local.\" A distant network signal is one received from outside the local network affiliate's area. It is referred to as a distant network signal because it originates in one place and is received in another. Local-into-local signals were first offered to satellite television subscribers in 1999 under the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA). It permitted, but did not require, satellite television companies to offer local-into-local signals. Subscribers who were eligible for distant network signals under SHVIA could also receive local-into-local, if offered in their area. Households are generally defined as either \"served\" or \"unserved\" under SHVERA based on the signal strength they can receive. Under the law, only unserved households are eligible to receive distant network television signals via satellite. \"Unserved\" households include those that are unable to receive a \"grade B\" signal via an over-the-air antenna; or were \"grandfathered\" per a May 1998 federal court ruling; (see below) have satellite TV dishes mounted on a recreational vehicle or commercial truck (that are not fixed dwellings). In the late 1990s, some satellite television companies broadcast distant network signals to subscribers who were not eligible to receive them. Broadcasters filed suit against those satellite television companies. In May 1998, a federal court ruled that a company called PrimeTime 24 had violated the Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA) by retransmitting broadcast network television signals to both served and unserved households. The court ruled in favor of the broadcasters, meaning that many satellite TV subscribers would have lost access to distant network signals. However, Congress was debating satellite TV legislation (SHVIA) at the time and chose to allow some of those subscribers—called \"grandfathered subscribers\"—to continue to receive the signals for five more years (until December 31, 2004). Under SHVIA, subscribers receiving distant network signals could also subscribe to local-into-local when it became available. In 2004, Congress again deliberated satellite TV legislation, ultimately passing SHVERA. Sections 103 and 204 of SHVERA differentiated three groups of subscribers: grandfathered, other, and future subscribers. In areas where local-into-local service was available, some had to choose between distant network signals or local-into-local. Each subscriber's situation was unique, complicating efforts to understand how the new provisions affected a particular household. This group consists of households that had been receiving distant network signals illegally per the 1998 Miami court ruling. Under SHVERA, if local-into-local was offered in their area, or became available later, this group was required to choose between retaining distant network signals or receiving local-into-local signals within 60 days of being notified by their satellite company. They could no longer receive both. This group consists of households who received distant network signals legally. Under SHVERA, if a satellite company offered local-into-local in a subscriber's area on January 1, 2005, these subscribers could receive both distant network signals and local-into-local signals. If a satellite company did not offer local-into-local service in the subscriber's area on January 1, 2005, but it became available later, the subscriber would then have to choose between distant network signals or local-into-local. This group consists of households that subscribe to satellite television after December 8, 2004, the date of enactment of SHVERA. If local-into-local service is offered in their area, they may not receive distant network signals. If local-into-local is not offered when they subscribe, and they are eligible for distant network signals (i.e. they are \"unserved\"), they may receive distant network signals until such a time as local-into-local is offered. To summarize, if local-into-local is offered in a particular area: subscribers who were receiving distant network signals at the time SHVERA was enacted (December 8, 2004), because they were grandfathered in, could continue to receive distant network signals, but could not receive local-into-local at the same time. They had to choose one or the other. subscribers who are receiving distant network signals because they cannot get a grade B signal may continue to receive distant network signals if their satellite TV provider was not offering local-into-local on January 1, 2005. If local-into-local becomes available after January 1, 2005, they will have to choose between distant network signals and local-into-local. subscribers to satellite television after the date of enactment of SHVERA (December 8, 2004) may receive distant network signals if they are eligible for them and local-into-local is not offered. If local-into-local later becomes available, they must subscribe to local-into-local. As noted above in the section \" Unserved Households ,\" EchoStar Communications, also known as the DISH Network, was charged with violating the Satellite Home Viewer Act in 1998. EchoStar chose to defend its actions, and the company's distant network signals have been unaffected during the eight years the issue has been litigated. In May 2006, an Atlanta appeals court ordered a permanent injunction on EchoStar's carriage of all distant signals, including those provided to eligible consumers who cannot receive a grade B signal. In order to avoid a circumstance in which customers would lose access to distant signals they were eligible to receive, negotiations were undertaken between EchoStar and the four major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX) to set the terms under which EchoStar could continue to carry those signals for eligible customers. A negotiated settlement was reached with three networks, but not with FOX. EchoStar claims that FOX chose not to negotiate a settlement because it is part of a vertically integrated company that is a partial owner of DirecTV, which would stand to gain customers at the expense of EchoStar if EchoStar's eligible customers could no longer receive distant FOX signals. FOX, on the other hand, counters that it was involved in this litigation for five years before its parent company took operational control of DirecTV, and having won the case in court, had no responsibility to negotiate a settlement that differed from the court's decision. On October 20, 2006, a Florida district court upheld the injunction and voided the proposed settlement reached by ABC, CBS, NBC, and EchoStar. The court set December 1, 2006, as the effective date of signal cutoff. Seven pieces of legislation were introduced that would have lessened the impact of the injunction ( S. 4067 and H.R. 6402 , S. 4068 and H.R. 6340 , S. 4074 , S. 4080 and H.R. 6384 ), but none were passed before the December deadline.", "completion": "response:\nIn 2004, Congress passed the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act, SHVERA, as part of the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 4818, P.L. 108-447).

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nUnder the Social Security Act, disabled individuals qualify for benefits only if they are determined to be unable to engage in \"substantial gainful activity\" (SGA). Under Section 223(d) of the Social Security Act, the Commissioner of Social Security is given the authority to promulgate regulations prescribing the criteria for determining when earnings demonstrate an individual's ability to engage in SGA. Since July 1999, the SGA amount has been adjusted annually to reflect the growth in average wages. In 2014, this amount is $1,070 a month. However, the same section of the law specifies that a different definition of SGA applies to individuals disabled by blindness. These individuals are considered to be engaging in SGA if their earnings exceed 1,800 a month (this amount is also adjusted annually to reflect growth in average wages). This different treatment for the blind began with enactment of P.L. 95 - 216 in 1977. During consideration of H.R. 9346 , the Social Security Financing Amendments of 1977, the Senate adopted by a voice vote an amendment by Senator Birch Bayh that provided disability benefits for blind individuals regardless of their ability to work or the amount of money they actually earned. The amendment was identical to S. 753 , a bill introduced by Senator Hubert Humphrey earlier in the year. Speaking in support of this amendment on the Senate floor, Senator Bayh stated, Social security disability insurance was designed to partially replace income loss due to a disability. Congress has previously recognized blindness as a distinct and unique condition. Certain economic consequences predictably follow the disability of blindness. It is comparable with the social security insurance concept to protect the blind from these adverse effects. If persons with a high earning capacity can return to work at all after becoming blind, they do so, almost without exception, at a much lower salary, and continue to suffer an adverse impact on their earning power. Moreover, working in a society adapted to vision entails extra costs for supportive services and special devices. The House-passed version of H.R. 9346 contained no similar provision. In conference, it was agreed that the House would recede with an amendment that struck the provisions of the Senate amendment but provided that the amount of earnings under the test of SGA that would terminate a blind individual's benefits would be increased to the monthly exempt amount for persons at or above the full retirement age (FRA) under the Social Security earnings test. The conferees stated that they were aware that this established a different test of SGA for blind persons than is applied administratively for persons with other disabilities. They went on to say that they did not intend that the new SGA level established for the blind should be applied to other types of disabilities. When the provision became effective in 1978, the SGA for non-blind recipients was $260 a month; for the blind, it was $334 a month, a difference of about 28% (see Figure A-1 in the Appendix). In subsequent years, the different SGA amounts occasionally became subject to debate. In 1988, the Social Security Advisory Council found that the preferential treatment for the blind was inappropriate and recommended that for new applicants the SGA level be lowered to that for all other disabled recipients. The council also recommended that the SGA level for blind persons already on the rolls be frozen at the then-current level ($700 a month). In 1992, the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming found that the higher SGA amount for the blind was unconstitutional because it violated the guarantee of equal protection under the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10 th Circuit overturned the district court's ruling, saying that there was a rational basis for Congress to place preferences for blind persons in the law. The Supreme Court refused to review the appeals court's decision. In 1996, when Congress enacted the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104 - 121 ) to substantially increase the earnings test limit for those who have attained retirement age over a period of five years, reaching $30,000 in 2002, it removed the linkage between the SGA level of the blind and the exempt amount for individuals who have attained the FRA. Instead their SGA level continued as before (i.e., adjusted annually to reflect growth in average wages). During deliberation of the bill, advocates of the blind sought to have the link maintained. During the mark-up of the bill in the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, an amendment was offered to do so. However, the amendment was rejected. On April 7, 2000, President William Clinton signed into law H.R. 5 , the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act ( P.L. 106-182 ), which eliminated the Social Security earnings test for recipients who have reached the FRA (effective in 2000). P.L. 106 - 182 permanently continued the severance between the earnings test and the SGA level of the blind enacted in P.L. 104 - 121 . In 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO, now known as the Government Accountability Office) was asked to examine whether the legislative rationale for an earnings limit for the blind that was higher than for individuals who have other disabilities was warranted. It concluded that the legislative rationale was based on the assumption that adverse employment experiences, including high job-related costs and unemployment, were greater for the blind than for persons who have other disabilities. However, GAO found that such experiences do not appear to be unique to the blind compared to other disabled recipients. GAO repeated this conclusion in a hearing on the topic held by the Social Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Ways and Means on March 23, 2000. Proponents of liberalizing the SGA limit for the blind maintain that the reasons given in 1977 to provide a different limit for the blind are just as valid today. Blindness is still a distinct and special condition, and they believe that the blind still merit being singled out for compensatory help. They point out that Congress has recognized the special nature of blindness by writing into law different disability criteria for the blind in regard to (1) insured status, (2) continued eligibility for benefits beyond the age of 54 regardless of the level of work activity, and (3) the use of functional capacity as part of the test of meeting the definition of disability. Proponents say that what Congress established then was that the \"retirement test\" (as the earnings test is sometimes called) for older workers should be applied to the blind, and therefore that they should be treated just like retired older workers whenever Congress makes changes to the retirement test. They say that if any change is made to lessen or eliminate the difference in SGA amounts, it should be to raise the SGA limits of the non-blind. Opponents of liberalizing the SGA limit for the blind maintain that the blind already receive enough preferential treatment and that to expand it further would be inequitable. Many of them think that even current law is too generous, because they see no logical reason that a particular group of disabled individuals should receive advantages over another. In their view, many other impairments could just as easily be viewed as needing special compensatory relief (e.g., quadriplegia and cancer). They dispute that the blind suffer higher rates of unemployment or work-related expenses. Opponents point out that the very definition of disability is that a person is unable to perform substantial work, and that the purpose of the SGA limit is to determine if, regardless of a person's medical condition, he or she demonstrates by work that he or she is not in fact disabled. From their perspective, if the SGA for the blind were further liberalized, especially to the point where it would approach or exceed the average wage of all workers, the concept of disability would become meaningless and weaken the basic concept of the disability program as a whole.", "completion": "response:\nIn the Social Security disability program, the level of earnings that constitute \"substantial gainful activity\" (SGA), and therefore disqualifies a person from receiving benefits, is set by regulation at $1,070 a month for 2014. However, the law provides a different SGA level for the blind at $1,800 a month for 2014, which is adjusted annually to reflect growth in average wages. This report discusses the reasons for these differing amounts and proposals to change them. The appendix section of the report charts the difference between the two amounts from 1975 to 2014."}

VA provides these benefits and services through four administrative units: theVeterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the NationalCemetery Administration (NCA), and the Board of Veterans' Appeals. VHA is primarily a directservice provider of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support servicesto veterans through an integrated health care system. Funding for VHA is an issue of perennial interest to Congress, especially with the increasingdemand for VA medical services and with some veterans increasingly having to wait more than sixmonths for a primary care or speciality care appointment. VHA is funded through multipleappropriation accounts, which are supplemented by other sources of revenue. Over the past decade,the composition of VHA's funding has changed. Not only has VA's appropriation account structurebeen modified, but also VA's ability to retain nonappropriated funds has increased. These changespresent challenges in comparing VHA funding over a period of time. Between FY1995 and FY2004, appropriations for VA medical care grew by 63%. For thefirst four years of this time period, from FY1995 through FY1999, appropriations for VA medicalcare grew by 6.7%, from $16.2 billion in FY1995 to $17.3 billion in FY1999. In comparison, duringthe last five years of this time period, from FY1999 through FY2004, VA medical careappropriations grew by 52.7%, from $17.3 billion in FY1999 to $26.4 billion in FY2004. Theseamounts do not include appropriations for medical research, medical administration andmiscellaneous operating expenses (MAMOE), and funds from nonappropriated funding sources. The total number of veteran enrollees has grown by 76.9% from FY1999, the first year VHAinstituted an enrollment system, to FY2004. During this same period the number of veteransreceiving medical care has grown by almost 50%, from 3.2 million veterans in FY1999 to anestimated 4.7 million veterans in FY2004.

In some instances, the President makes these appointments using authorities granted to the President alone. Other appointments are made with the advice and consent of the Senate via the nomination and confirmation of appointees. Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation are often referred to with the abbreviation PAS. This report identifies, for the 112 th Congress, all nominations to full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation in 40 organizations in the executive branch (27 independent agencies, 6 agencies in the Executive Office of the President [EOP], and 7 multilateral organizations) and 4 agencies in the legislative branch. It excludes appointments to executive departments and to regulatory and other boards and commissions. A pair of tables presents information for each agency in this report. The first table in each pair provides information on full-time positions requiring Senate confirmation as of the end of the 112 th Congress and the pay levels of those positions. The second table for each agency tracks appointment activity within the 112 th Congress by the Senate (confirmations, rejections, returns to the President, and elapsed time between nomination and confirmation) as well as further related presidential activity (including withdrawals and recess appointments). In some instances, no appointment action occurred within an agency during the 112 th Congress. Information for this report was compiled using the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS) at http://www.lis.gov/nomis/ , the Congressional Record (daily edition), the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents , telephone discussions with agency officials, agency websites, the United States Code , and the 2012 Plum Book ( United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions ). Related Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports regarding the presidential appointments process, nomination activity for other executive branch positions, recess appointments, and other appointments-related matters may be found at http://www.crs.gov . During the 112 th Congress, President Barack Obama submitted 34 nominations to the Senate for full-time positions in independent agencies, agencies in the EOP, multilateral agencies, and legislative branch agencies. Of these nominations, 27 were confirmed, 6 were returned to the President, and 1 was withdrawn. The President made one recess appointment during this period to a position in organizations covered in this report. Table 1 summarizes the appointment activity. The length of time a given nomination may be pending in the Senate varies widely. Some nominations are confirmed within a few days, others are not confirmed for several months, and some are never confirmed. For each nomination covered by this report and confirmed in the 112 th Congress, the report provides the number of days between nomination and confirmation (\"days to confirm\"). The mean (average) number of days elapsed between nomination and confirmation was 142.7. The median number of days elapsed was 112.0. Agency profiles in this report are organized in two parts: a table listing the organization's full-time PAS positions as of the end of the 112 th Congress and a table listing appointment action for vacant positions during the 112 th Congress. Data for these tables were collected from several authoritative sources. As noted, some agencies had no nomination activity during this time. In each agency profile, the first of the two tables identifies, as of the end of the 112 th Congress, each full-time PAS position in the organization and its pay level. For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, the pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule, which, as of January 2013, ranged from level I ($199,700) for Cabinet-level offices to level V ($145,700) for lower-ranked positions. The second table, the appointment action table, provides, in chronological order, information concerning each nomination. It shows the name of the nominee, position involved, date of nomination, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation. It also notes actions other than confirmation (i.e., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President). The appointment action tables with more than one nominee to a position also list statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. Each nomination action table provides the average \"days to confirm\" in two ways: mean and median. Although the mean is a more familiar measure, it may be influenced by outliers in the data. The median, by contrast, does not tend to be influenced by outliers. In other words, a nomination that took an extraordinarily long time might cause a significant change in the mean, but the median would be unaffected. Examining both numbers offers more information with which to assess the central tendency of the data. Appendix A provides two tables. Table A-1 relists all appointment action identified in this report and is organized alphabetically by the appointee's last name. Table entries identify the agency to which each individual was appointed, position title, nomination date, date confirmed or other final action, and duration count for confirmed nominations. In the final two rows, the table also includes the mean and median values for the days to confirm column. Table A-2 provides summary data on the appointments identified in this report and is organized by agency type, including independent executive agencies, agencies in the EOP, multilateral organizations, and agencies in the legislative branch. The table summarizes the number of positions, nominations submitted, individual nominees, confirmations, nominations returned, and nominations withdrawn for each agency grouping. It also includes mean and median values for the number of days taken to confirm nominations in each category. During the 112 th Congress, the Presidential Appointments Streamlining and Efficiency Act ( P.L. 112-166 ) was enacted, which eliminated the requirement for the Senate's advice and consent for 163 positions in federal agencies. A number of those positions, listed in Appendix B , have been included in previous versions of this tracking report. This report notes each agency and position affected.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nMost federal and state programs of financial assistance to poor and low-income families either increase income or subsidize the purchase of goods and services to help them meet their basic, immediate consumption needs. The exceptions are education and training programs, that seek to build \"human capital.\" More recently, Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) have been developed to help low-income families build financial capital. IDA programs are operated by community-based organizations (including faith-based organizations), as well as state and local governments in partnership with community-based organizations. From the participant's viewpoint, IDAs operate much like retirement 401(k) plans: the participant makes contributions, which are matched (at varying rates) by the program. Withdrawals from IDAs are restricted. Funds can be withdrawn to finance specific activities and purchases—generally, education, the purchase of a home, and to start a business. An individual's contributions may also be withdrawn for other purposes, but this leads to the loss of matching funds. In addition to providing matching funds for accounts, IDA programs also provide financial literacy education, case management, and supportive services to participants. This report describes IDA programs funded by two major federal grants: the Assets for Independence (AFI) Act of 1998 and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program created in the 1996 welfare reform law. Other federal initiatives that provide for more targeted IDAs (e.g., for refugees and for families in assisted housing) are not discussed in this report. The Assets for Independence Act (AFI, P.L. 105-285 ) authorized up to $25 million per year for FY1999 to 2003 for competitively awarded IDA demonstration programs. Congress has continued the AFI program absent an authorization. The Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) administers the AFI program. Table 1 provides a funding history for IDAs under the AFI program. AFI is funded at $19 million for FY2014. AFI grantees must raise nonfederal funds to operate AFI IDAs. The AFI federal grant to an individual grantee cannot exceed the lesser of (1) the amount of nonfederal resources raised for the program, or (2) $1 million. The AFI Act authorizes competitive grants for IDA programs to nonprofit organizations; state, local, and tribal governments that apply with non-profits; credit unions; and organizations designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as community development financial institutions. Credit unions and community development financial institutions must demonstrate a collaborative relationship with local community-based organizations whose activities are designed to address poverty. Faith-based organizations may also operate IDA programs. Additionally, the AFI Act \"grandfathers\" in eligibility to operate an IDA program to state programs funded at $1 million or higher that were in operation on the date of enactment. \"Grandfathered\" state programs need not comply with AFI's rules. Under this provision, Pennsylvania and Indiana received AFI funds. Participation in AFI Act IDA programs is limited to persons who are eligible for TANF assistance; or live in a household with income below 200% of the poverty line or have and have a net worth of less than $10,000. The net worth test takes into account the market value of all assets except the household's primary residence and the value of one motor vehicle. IDAs may be established for the benefit of the participant, as well as his/her spouse and dependents. Since IDAs are targeted to low-income families who might qualify for government aid based on low income and assets, the AFI Act requires that IDA funds be ignored when determining eligibility for federal assistance programs. Participants are required to contribute to their IDA with cash or a check. Contributions from earnings are matched by a minimum $1 for each $1 in participant contributions. Matching amounts are funded from both federal and nonfederal sources, with a minimum 50% funded from nonfederal sources. Maximum matching amounts from federal funds are limited to $2,000 for any one individual and $4,000 for any one household. Participants may withdraw their contributions, match funds, and interest for specified purposes. These specified purposes are as follows: Post-secondary educational expenses. Payments are made directly from the IDA to an educational institution for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment. The purchase of a home. Payments are made directly from the IDA to cover the acquisition costs (including the closing costs) of the home. The acquisition costs cannot exceed 120% of the average purchase price of similar residences in the area. Starting a business. The IDA may be used to finance expenditures under a business plan to acquire plant, equipment, working capital and finance inventory expenses. The business plan must be approved by a financial institution, micro enterprise development organization, or a nonprofit loan fund. The AFI Act allows participants to withdraw their contributions from the IDA to pay medical expenses for the participant and his/her spouse or dependents; payments to prevent the eviction of the participant from her home; and necessary living expenses following loss of employment. Match funds and interest earnings cannot be withdrawn for these emergency expenses. Under the AFI Act, IDA programs must use funds to provide financial literacy education (economic literacy, budgeting, credit, and credit counseling) to IDA participants. Of the federal and nonfederal funds used in the IDA program, up to 15% may be used for such financial literacy, administration, and assisting with an evaluation of the program. As a demonstration program, the AFI Act IDA program has an evaluation component. Organizations operating IDAs are required to submit annual progress reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HHS is required to submit periodic reports to Congress. Additionally, the AFI law required an evaluation, which was conducted by the Abt Research organization. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a federal block grant that gives states broad flexibility in the use of its funds in aiding needy families with children. Generally, TANF funds (and required state monies spent under its \"maintenance of effort\" requirement) can be used to further any of its statutory goals. In addition, TANF provides specific authority and rules for states to operate IDA programs. States may use TANF and state maintenance of effort funds for IDAs either as an activity that furthers the statute's broad goals, in which case it must conform only to general TANF rules, or under TANF's specific authority to use funds for IDAs, in which case it must follow TANF's specific IDA rules. The TANF law provides explicit authority for states to use federal block grant funds for IDA programs and rules for their operation. Under this provision, IDA programs may be established for individuals eligible for TANF assistance who may make contributions from earned income to the account. Many of the rules for the TANF IDA are similar to the rules under the AFI Act: contributions are to be matched through a nonprofit organization or a state and local government (though there are no limits to matching rates or amounts); withdrawals may be made for educational expenses, purchase of a first home, or starting a business; and the IDA is not to be considered when determining the financial eligibility status of a recipient applying for or receiving federal aid. Eligibility to participate in TANF IDA programs is limited to those \"eligible\" for TANF assistance. There are no provisions for \"emergency\" withdrawals from TANF IDAs. As mentioned above, IDAs may also be established under TANF's authority to permit federal and state funds to be used to accomplish any TANF purpose. Except for general requirements regarding the use of TANF funds, states are free to design IDA programs without regard to federal limits and rules. For example, such IDAs may be established for purposes other than educational expenses, home purchase, or starting a business—such as purchasing a car. Boshara, Ray.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nStates that choose to cover pregnant women through the §1115 waiver authority must submit a proposal to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for approval. States with approved §1115 demonstration programs define the available pregnancy-related services in their waiver terms and conditions agreements. States that opt to extend SCHIP coverage to unborn children must submit an SPA to CMS for approval specifying the pregnancy-related services. Under the SCHIP SPA option, covered services must be related to the pregnancy or to conditions that could complicate the pregnancy, including those for diagnosis or treatment of illnesses or medical conditions that might threaten the health of the unborn child. Care after delivery for the mother, such as postpartum services, is generally not covered as part of the title XXI SPA option. Although CMS requires the care to be directed at the unborn child, the SCHIP unborn child SPA option effectively enables states to provide prenatal care to pregnant women including those with incomes at or above the Medicaid income eligibility thresholds and for individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid (or SCHIP) for other reasons, such as immigration status or incarceration. Finally, for the family coverage option, pregnancy-related benefits are those offered by participating private health plans. Table 1 summarizes the variation in pregnancy coverage among states with §1115 waivers and those using the SCHIP unborn child SPA option. As of October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services using SCHIP funds. Of those, 12 states extended coverage through unborn child SCHIP SPAs and 6 states used the §1115 waiver authority (Rhode Island extends coverage to pregnant women through both authorities). The highest upper-income eligibility thresholds for pregnant women and/or unborn children under SCHIP was 300% FPL in California. Seven states established upper-income limits at 200% FPL. Four states exceeded 200% FPL, and six states set maximum income levels below 200% FPL. Of the 12 states that offer pregnancy-related services to unborn children under the SCHIP SPAs, all but Tennessee extended coverage to the unborn children of undocumented aliens who otherwise would not have access to federally funded pregnancy-related services, except through emergency Medicaid. Two states used SCHIP SPAs to extend coverage to the unborn children of incarcerated women who are otherwise ineligible for SCHIP coverage. Covered services under the §1115 waiver programs and the SCHIP SPAs generally consisted of comprehensive pregnancy-related services including prenatal care, labor and delivery services, and access to some form of coverage during the postpartum period. However, the length of coverage (e.g., prenatal period through labor and delivery, or prenatal period through 60 days postpartum period) and financing streams for the care associated with each of these pregnancy phases varied across states. For example, some states offered coverage from conception through 60 days postpartum care (financed with SCHIP funds), whereas others segmented the coverage to include prenatal care (financed with SCHIP funds), labor and delivery (financed with emergency Medicaid funds), and postpartum care (financed with state-only funds). In these states, program specialists pointed out that the pregnancy-related care is seamless to the mother despite the administrative complexities required of the state to submit claims under multiple funding streams. Three states indicated that the coverage offered to pregnant women and/or unborn children was comprehensive and not limited to pregnancy-related services. An additional four states specified that the available care included pregnancy-related care and associated health services including, for example, medically necessary dental or mental health benefits as long as the care was necessary to promote the health of the unborn child. Postpartum care differs among states that chose to extend pregnancy coverage under the §1115 waiver authority as compared with those that offered coverage to unborn children under the SCHIP unborn child SPAs. There were 15 states that offered 60 days of postpartum care to at least some of their eligible populations, including each of the 6 states that offered pregnancy coverage under the §1115 waiver authority. Among the SCHIP SPA states, five states financed 60 days of postpartum care with state-only funds. Four SCHIP SPA states extended 60 days of postpartum care using SCHIP funds. CMS permitted this financing arrangement despite the fact that the unborn child regulation clearly states that federal SCHIP-financed care ends with the birth of the child. The reason CMS permits this is because the state has a global rate for their pregnancy services that includes the cost of prenatal care, labor and delivery, and 60 days of postpartum care. One SCHIP SPA state provided SCHIP-financed postpartum care through the end of the month that the child was delivered because those services have already been paid for under the monthly managed care capitation payment. Two SCHIP SPA states did not offer any form of care for the mother after the birth of the child except in the case of an emergency during which the mother would have access to emergency Medicaid services. Finally, two states (one §1115 waiver state and one SCHIP SPA state) provided access to extended family planning services and supplies as a part of their postnatal care benefit.", "completion": "response:\nThe State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) does not include pregnancy status among its eligibility criteria and does not cover individuals over age 18. Under SCHIP, states can cover pregnant women aged 19 and older in one of three ways: (1) states may apply for waivers of program rules to extend coverage to adults such as pregnant women (§1115 waiver authority); (2) states may provide health benefits coverage, including prenatal care and delivery services, to unborn children through an SCHIP state plan amendment (SPA) as permitted through regulation (Federal Register, vol. 67, no. 191, Wednesday, October 2, 2002, Rules and Regulations); or (3) states may offer a \"family coverage option\" that allows them to provide coverage under a group health plan that may include maternity care to adult females in eligible families. Section 2105(c)(3) of the Social Security Act allows states to cover entire families including parents if the purchase of family coverage is cost-effective when compared with the cost of covering only the targeted low-income children in the families involved, and would not substitute for other health insurance coverage. E-mail correspondence (from June 7, 2007) with Kathleen Farrell, the CMS Director of the SCHIP program, indicates that New Jersey and Massachusetts are the only states with operational family coverage variance programs. As of October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services using SCHIP funds. Of those, 6 states used the §1115 waiver authority and 12 states extended coverage through unborn child SPAs (Rhode Island extends coverage to pregnant women through both authorities). This report summarizes the variation in pregnancy coverage and the financing streams associated with such coverage among these states. This report will be updated as state activity warrants."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS), at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, has statutory authority for weather forecasting and for issuing storm warnings (15 U.S.C. §313). The NWS provides weather, water, and climate forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters, and ocean areas. The 114 th Congress has expressed its interest in improving forecasts and warnings to protect life and property in the United States from severe weather events through its role in oversight, appropriations, and the authorization of language regarding NWS. NWS is one of several line offices within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 2014, NWS restructured its organization structure, which is reflected in its annual congressional budget justifications since then. This report includes tables that summarize appropriated funding for NWS, and the programs within NWS that generate forecasts and warnings, and the funding for NWS in its restructured accounts since FY2014. The report also includes a table with a brief summary and analysis of various bills introduced in the 114 th Congress that would have some bearing, directly or indirectly, on NWS operations. To date, none of the bills has been enacted. NWS's core mission is to provide weather forecasts and warnings for protection of life and property. Apart from the budget for procuring weather satellites, NWS received the most funding of any agency or program within the FY2016 budget for NOAA. Prior to FY2015, NWS's Local Warnings and Forecasts (LW&F) program received approximately 70% of NWS funding each year (from FY2009 through FY2014, see Table 1 ), suggesting that short-term weather prediction and warning is a high priority for NWS and for NOAA, in accord with NOAA's statutory authority. The 122 NWS weather forecast offices distributed throughout the United States provide the forecasts and warnings familiar to most people (see box below). Starting in FY2015, NWS restructured its programs, spreading out the LW&F activities among five separate subprograms. The restructuring makes it difficult to compare funding for LW&F activities prior to FY2015 with funding for forecast and warning activities after FY2014. According to NOAA, the restructuring was \"part of a broader effort to align the NWS budget to function and link to performance.\" Also, NOAA cited two reports that included recommendations for realigning and restructuring its operations. NOAA stated that its commitment to forecasts and warnings continues: \"NWS is dedicated to serving the American public by providing a broad spectrum of weather, climate, and hydrological forecast guidance and decision support services. NWS strives to meet society's need for weather and hydrological forecast information.\" Table 2 displays NWS funding in the restructured accounts for FY2014 through the FY2017 proposed budget. It also shows the percentage of total NOAA funding represented by each account within NWS. As stated above, the restructuring makes it difficult to compare LW&F funding prior to FY2015 with the restructured accounting; however, total NWS funding as a percentage of total NOAA funding appears to have dropped by a percentage point or two in the last few years. The proposed budget for NWS in FY2017 is nearly $5 million less than the enacted budget in FY2016, whereas total proposed spending for NOAA in FY2017 represents an increase of slightly more than 1% over the FY2016 enacted figure. Both the House and the Senate appropriations committees have reported FY2017 appropriations bills that would fund NOAA, including NWS, for FY2017. Reports accompanying each appropriation bill contain language that may influence NWS operations in FY2017 and beyond. In addition, several bills were introduced in the 114 th Congress that, if enacted, could affect NWS. Some of the bills focus on single topics, such as increasing the number of Doppler radar stations across the country. Other bills would address a broader array of programs within NOAA and NWS. Several bills may affect NWS only indirectly, such as those that would authorize strategies to improve resilience to extreme weather events. Table 3 lists legislation introduced in the 114 th Congress that may affect NWS and briefly summarizes relevant provisions. Many different components and programs within NOAA contribute to NWS's mission of providing weather forecasts and warnings. Several of the bills listed in Table 3 indicate congressional interest in some of those components and programs, such as the research programs within the office of Oceans and Atmospheric Research at NOAA, and in the challenge of improving the integration of research results into operational weather forecasting (e.g., H.R. 1561 , S. 1331 ). Several of the bills are more narrowly focused, such as those that would require additional Doppler radars to provide coverage for large population centers or state capitals (e.g., H.R. 3538 , H.R. 5089 , S. 2058 ) or those that would require additional personnel at NWS forecast offices (e.g., S. 1573 ). NOAA weather satellites are also critical components of the NWS's core mission, and Congress has been concerned about possible gaps in coverage and about the future of the weather satellite programs. Congress has expressed concern about the future of the weather satellite program in annual appropriations bills and accompanying reports and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future, as the budget for satellite acquisitions continues to be a major component of overall NOAA annual spending. Furthermore, Congress likely will continue to introduce legislation that would shape NWS operations, directly or indirectly, in an overall effort to improve NWS's ability to provide forecasts and warnings for protection of life and property in the United States.", "completion": "response:\nThe mission of the National Weather Service (NWS) is to provide weather forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property.

For each title of the regular FSGG appropriations bill, Table 1 lists the enacted amounts for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, as well as amounts requested by the President for FY2013. Title I of the FSGG appropriations bill provides funding for the Department of the Treasury and its bureaus, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The President requested $13.24 billion for the Treasury Department for FY2013, an increase of $1.03 billion above FY2012 enacted amounts. The President's request includes a proposal to create a new bureau, the Fiscal Service, which would result from the merger of the Financial Management Service and the Bureau of the Public Debt. According to the budget request, the new bureau would reduce duplicative functions. Table 2 lists the enacted amounts for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, as well as amounts requested by the President for FY2013. Title II of the FSGG appropriations bill provides funding for all but three offices under the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The President requested $649 million for the EOP for FY2013, a decrease of $10 million below FY2012 enacted amounts. Table 3 lists the enacted amounts or FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, as well as amounts requested by the President for FY2013. Title III of the FSGG appropriations bill provides funding for the judicial branch of the federal government, including the Supreme Court. As a co-equal branch of government, the judiciary presents its budget to the President, who transmits it to Congress unaltered. The President's FY2013 budget request for the judiciary is $7.19 billion, which is $219 million more than appropriated for FY2012. Table 4 lists the enacted amounts for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, as well as amounts requested by the President for FY2013. Title IV of the FSGG appropriations bill provides funding for the District of Columbia. The President's FY2013 budget request includes $680 million for special federal payments to the District, an increase of $15 million above FY2012 enacted amounts. Table 5 lists the enacted amounts for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, as well as amounts requested by the President for FY2013. Title V provides funding for more than two dozen independent agencies which perform a wide range of functions, including the management of federal real property (GSA), the regulation of financial institutions (SEC), and mail delivery (USPS). The President's FY2013 budget request includes $24.05 billion for independent agencies that receive their funding through the FSGG appropriations bill, an increase of $159 million over FY2012 funding levels.

ESEA programs are authorized through FY2008, and the 110 th Congress is considering whether to amend and extend the ESEA. This report outlines major highlights of the NCLB. Only the most basic provisions of this act are briefly described in this report; other CRS reports provide more specific and substantial analyses of the major provisions of the NCLB. Major features of the NCLB include the following: (a) states were required to implement standards-based assessments in reading and mathematics for pupils in each of grades 3-8 by the end of the 2005-2006 school year, and at three grade levels in science by the end of the 2007-2008 school year; (b) grants are provided to states for assessment development; (c) all states are required to participate in National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests in 4 th and 8 th grade reading and mathematics every second year; (d) states must annually apply adequate yearly progress (AYP) standards, incorporating a goal of all pupils reaching a proficient or higher level of achievement by the end of the 2013-14 school year, to each public school, local education agency (LEA), and the state overall; (e) a sequence of consequences, including public school choice and supplemental services options, must be implemented for schools and LEAs that fail to meet AYP standards for two or more consecutive years; (f) ESEA Title I-A allocation formulas have been modified to increase targeting on high-poverty LEAs and to move Puerto Rico toward parity with the states; (g) by the end of the 2005-06 school year, all paraprofessionals paid with Title I-A funds were to have completed at least two years of higher education or met a \"rigorous standard of quality\"; (h) several new programs aimed at improving reading instruction have been initiated; (i) teacher programs have been consolidated into a state grant authorizing a wide range of activities including teacher recruitment, professional development, and hiring; (j) states and LEAs participating in Title I-A were to ensure that teachers meet the act's definition of \"highly qualified\" by the end of the 2005-2006 school year; (k) almost all states and LEAs are authorized to transfer a portion of the funds they receive among several programs; (l) federal support of public school choice has been expanded in several respects; (m) several previous programs have been consolidated into a state grant supporting integration of technology into K-12 education; (n) the Bilingual and Emergency Immigrant Education Acts have been consolidated into a single formula grant, with previous limits on the share of grants for specific instructional approaches eliminated; and (o) the 21 st Century Community Learning Center program has been converted into a formula grant with increased focus on after-school activities. Major provisions that were in the House- or Senate-passed versions of H.R. 1 (107 th Congress) but were not included in the final legislation include the Senate bill's provisions for mandatory funding at specified levels for Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B grants to states, discipline provisions for children with disabilities, authorization for up to seven states to eliminate a wide range of program requirements in return for increased accountability in terms of pupil outcomes, and pest management in schools; and the provisions in both the House- and Senate-passed versions for aggregate (i.e., not program-specific) performance bonuses or sanctions, especially for states.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe United States is a member of five multilateral development banks (MDBs): the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), Asian Development Bank (AsDB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). It also belongs to two similar organizations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the North American Development Bank (NADBank). The World Bank also administers trust funds, focused on particular global issues such as food security and the environment. The MDBs have similar programs, though they all differ somewhat in their institutional structure and emphasis. Each has a president and executive board that manages or supervises all of its programs and operations. Except for the EBRD, which makes only market-based loans, all the MDBs make both market-based loans to middle-income developing countries and concessional loans to the poorest countries. Their loans are made to governments or to organizations having government repayment guarantees. In each MDB, the same staff prepares both the market-based and the concessional loans, using the same standards and procedures for both. The main differences between them are the repayment terms and the countries which qualify for them. The MDBs also have specialized facilities which have their own operating staff and management but report to the bank's president and executive board. The World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the IDB's Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC) make loans to or equity investments in private-sector firms in developing countries (on commercial terms) without government repayment guarantees. The AsDB makes similar loans from its market-rate loan account. The World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) underwrites private investments in developing countries (on commercial terms) to protect against noneconomic risk. At the IDB, the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) helps Latin American countries institute policy reforms aimed at stimulating domestic and international investment. It also funds worker retraining and programs for small and micro-enterprises. The MIF originated as part of President Bush's 1990 Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI). The NADBank was created by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to fund environmental infrastructure projects in the U.S.-Mexico border region. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), created in 1977, focuses on reducing poverty and hunger in poor countries through agricultural development. Finally, the World Bank also serves as the trustee for several targeted multilateral development funds, for which the Administration has requested and Congress has appropriated funds. These multilateral funds include the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The MDBs' concessional aid programs are funded with money donated by their wealthier member country governments. Periodically, as the stock of uncommitted MDB funds begins to run low, the major donors negotiate a new funding plan that specifies their new contribution shares. Loans from the MDBs' market-rate loan facilities are funded with money borrowed in world capital markets. The IFC and IIC fund their loans and equity investments partly with money contributed by their members and partly with funds borrowed from commercial capital markets. The MDBs' borrowings are backed by the subscriptions of their member countries. They provide a small part of their capital subscriptions (3% to 5% of the total for most MDBs) in the form of paid-in capital. The rest they subscribe as callable capital. Callable capital is a contingent liability, payable only if an MDB becomes bankrupt and lacks sufficient funds to repay its own creditors. It cannot be called to provide the banks with additional loan funds. Countries' voting shares are determined mainly by the size of their contributions. The United States is the largest stockholder in most MDBs, and has maintained this position to preserve veto power in some institutions over major policy decisions. Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Tables 1-4 show the amounts the Administration has requested and Congress has appropriated annually since FY2000 to the multilateral development banks. Note that the figures and tables do not include callable capital. Since the early 1980s, Congress has authorized but not appropriated callable capital. As Figure 1 illustrates, appropriations to the MDBs increased dramatically starting in 2009, from $1.28 billion in 2008 to a peak of $2.67 billion in FY2014. The uptick was driven largely by capital increases for the nonconcessional lending facilities at the MDBs in response to the global financial crisis, as well as the proliferation of trust funds administered by the World Bank focused on specific policy issues. As these commitments have been met, particularly in funding the capital increases at the MDBs, overall funding levels started declining. Appropriations have declined over the past three fiscal years to $1.52 billion in FY2018. President Trump campaigned on an \"America First\" platform and has signaled a reorientation of U.S. foreign policy. In March 2017, the Trump Administration proposed cutting $650 million over three years compared to the commitments made under the Obama Administration. For FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $1.42 billion for the MDBs, a 16% cut from the amount appropriated in FY2017. The bulk of the request—$1.32 billion, about 90%—would fund U.S. commitments to concessional lending facilities at the MDBs, particularly IDA. The request also includes funding toward the capital increase at the AfDB, multilateral trust funds focused on environmental issues, and international food security programs.", "completion": "response:\nThis report shows in tabular form how much the Administration requested and how much Congress appropriated for U.S. payments to the multilateral development banks (MDBs) since 2000. Multilateral development banks provide financial assistance to developing countries in order to promote economic and social development. The United States belongs to several multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and four regional development banks (the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). It also belongs to the North American Development Bank, which is a binational (U.S.-Mexico) development bank; the International Fund for Agricultural Development, which focuses on poverty and hunger in developing countries; and several trust funds administered by the World Bank, which focus on specific global issues, such as food security and the environment. The United States appropriates funding on an annual basis to various multilateral development banks and related funds. In FY2018, U.S. appropriations for MDB programs totaled $1.5 billion. Most of the FY2018 funding (about 90%) went to the concessional lending facilities at the MDBs, which provide grants and low-cost loans to the world's poorest countries. Congress also provided funding for the African Development Bank, IFAD, and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), administered by the World Bank. The Treasury Department manages U.S. participation in the MDBs, and the Administration's request is submitted as part of Treasury International Programs. For FY2019, the Administration has requested $1.4 billion for the MDBs and related funds. Most of the funding would go to the concessional lending facilities at the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. It would also provide funding for the African Development Bank. The Administration has proposed cutting U.S. contributions to IFAD and reducing U.S. contributions to the GEF.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nEarmark disclosure rules in both the House and Senate were implemented with the stated intention of bringing more transparency to congressionally directed spending. The administrative responsibilities associated with these new rules vary by chamber. This report outlines the major administrative responsibilities of Senators and committees of the Senate associated with the chamber's earmark disclosure rules. Senate Rule XLIV prohibits a vote on a motion to proceed to consider a measure or a vote on adoption of a conference report, unless the chair of the committee or the majority leader (or designee) certifies that a complete list of earmarks and the name of each Senator requesting each earmark is available on a publicly accessible congressional website in a searchable form at least 48 hours before the vote. If a Senator proposes a floor amendment containing an additional earmark, those items must be printed in the Congressional Record as soon as \"practicable.\" Rule XLIV, paragraph 5, explicitly defines congressionally directed spending item, limited tax benefit, and limited tariff benefit as follows: Congressionally directed spending item - a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula driven or competitive award process. Limited tax benefit - any revenue provision that (A) provides a federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to a particular beneficiary or limited group of beneficiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and (B) contains eligibility criteria that are not uniform in application with respect to potential beneficiaries of such provision. Limited tariff benefit - a provision modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States in a manner that benefits 10 or fewer entities. If the earmark certification requirements have not been met, a point of order may lie against consideration of the measure or vote on the conference report. A point of order would not apply to floor amendments. Senate earmark disclosure rules apply to any congressional earmark included in either the text of the bill or the committee report accompanying the bill, as well as the conference report and joint explanatory statement. The disclosure requirements apply to items in authorizing legislation, appropriations legislation, and tax measures. Furthermore, they apply not only to measures reported by committees but also to unreported measures, amendments, House bills, and conference reports. Under Senate Rule XLIV, paragraph 6, a Senator requesting that a congressional earmark be included in a measure is required to provide a written statement to the chair and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction that includes the Senator's name; the name and address of the intended earmark recipient (if there is no specific recipient, the location of the intended activity should be included); in the case of a limited tax or tariff benefit, identification of the individual or entities reasonably anticipated to benefit to the extent known to the Senator; the purpose of the earmark; and a certification that neither the Senator nor the Senator's immediate family has a financial interest in such an earmark. It is important to note that, when submitting earmark requests, individual committees and subcommittees often have their own additional administrative requirements beyond those required by Senate rules (e.g., prioritizing requests or submitting request forms electronically). The Senate Appropriations Committee, for example, has stated that it will require Members requesting earmarks to post information regarding their earmark requests on their personal website. This information must be posted at the time of the request and must include the purpose of the earmark and why it is a valuable use of taxpayer funds. The committees may also establish relevant policy requirements (e.g., requiring matching funds for earmark requests) or restrictions (e.g., not considering earmark requests for certain appropriations accounts or disallowing multi-year funding requests). In addition, committees and subcommittees often have deadlines, especially for earmark requests in appropriations legislation. For this reason, it is important to check with individual committees and subcommittees to learn of any supplemental earmark request requirements or restrictions. The committee of jurisdiction is responsible for identifying earmarks in the legislative text and any accompanying reports. Therefore, when it is not clear whether a senatorial request constitutes an earmark, the committee of jurisdiction may be able to provide guidance. When submitting an earmark request, it may be relevant whether the Senator wants the earmark to be included in the text of the bill or the committee report accompanying the bill. Committees may make an administrative distinction between these two categories in terms of the submission of earmark requests, and there may be policy implications of an earmark's placement in either the bill text or the committee report. For example, under Executive Order 13457, issued in January 2008, executive agencies are directed not to commit, obligate, or expend funds that were the result of an earmark included in non-statutory language, such as a committee report. If, during consideration of a measure, a Senator proposes an amendment that contains an additional earmark, the Senator shall ensure that a list of earmarks (and the name of any other Senator who submitted a request for each earmark included) is printed in the Congressional Record as soon as \"practicable.\" Under the Senate rule, earmark disclosure responsibilities of Senate committees and conference committees fall into three major categories: (1) determining if a spending provision is an earmark; (2) compiling earmark requests for presentation, and (3) certifying that requirements under Rule XLIV have been met. Committees of jurisdiction may use their discretion to decide what constitutes an earmark. Definitions in Senate rules, as well as past earmark designations during the 110 th Congress, may provide guidance in determining if a certain provision constitutes an earmark. Senate Rule XLIV states that before consideration is in order on a measure or conference report, a list of included earmarks and their sponsors must be identified through lists, charts, or some means and made available on a publicly accessible congressional website for at least 48 hours. The Senate Appropriations Committee has stated that it will make earmark disclosure tables publicly available the same day that a subcommittee reports the bill. In the case of measures, the list of earmarks (and Senate sponsors) on the congressional website must be \"searchable.\" Lists associated with conference reports should also be in a searchable format but only to the extent it is technically feasible. Senate rules state that a committee report containing a list of earmarks (and their sponsors) that is available online satisfies the disclosure requirement. The rule also requires the applicable committee to make the certifications of no financial interest available online. The rule does not specify how long after consideration any of these required materials must be maintained. The rule states that consideration of a measure or conference report is not in order until the applicable committee chair or the majority leader (or designee) \"certifies\" that the requirements stated above have been met. While the rule does not state what constitutes certification, it has been the practice of the committee chair to make a statement on the Senate floor or submit a written statement to be printed in the Congressional Record confirming compliance with Rule XLIV's disclosure requirements. An example of a certification letter is provided below.", "completion": "response:\nEarmark disclosure rules in both the House and the Senate establish certain administrative responsibilities that vary by chamber.

Further, Senate committees are responsible for compiling and presenting such information in accord with Senate rules. In the Senate, disclosure rules apply to any congressional earmark, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit included in either the text of a bill or any report accompanying the measure, including a conference report and joint explanatory statement.

State responses to this CCDF plan provisionvaried in detail and structure. Appendix A reflects the language used by states intheir CCDF plans, with minor editing for consistency and clarity. Although all statesprovide responses to this provision, it is unclear for some states whether these threegroups receive priority relative to other families eligible for subsidies, or in whatorder these families will be served. For example, in New Hampshire, TANFfamilies, transitioning families, and at-risk families are described as having priorityover other families (with the exception of families that already have a child receivinga subsidy and need care for an additional child); however, there is no indication ofhow these three groups of families receive priority relative to each other . In addition,the information provided by a few states did not specifically address how thesegroups of families are treated by the state. In these cases, the table entry reads \"noinformation.\" Appendix A1.

It repealed three welfare-relatedchild care programs and initiated a new set of federal rules referred to as the Child Care andDevelopment Fund (CCDF). The CCDF combines funds provided under Section 418 of the SocialSecurity Act established by PRWORA with funds provided under the Child Care and DevelopmentBlock Grant (CCDBG). Both streams of funding are authorized through FY2002. Funds aredistributed as grants to states for their use in subsidizing child care services to low-income familieswith children. Federal law defines eligible children as those under age 13 residing with a family whose income does not exceed 85% of the State Median Income (SMI), taking into account family size. Thefederal eligibility rules are maximum income limits for states in designing their CCDF programs. States may adopt income eligibility limits below that maximum, and currently, all but nine stateshave indeed set a lower eligibility limit. Regardless of the established limits, because CCDF is notan entitlement for individuals, states are not required to aid families even if their incomes fall belowstate-determined eligibility thresholds. Although states are not required to guarantee child care for welfare families, states may give special treatment to families receiving assistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families(TANF) program, recognizing that under TANF, both states and individuals are now subject to workrequirements. Generally, TANF families continue to have some special status in states' CCDFprograms. In some states, TANF families are categorically eligible for services, although they maynot actually receive service because funding may not always be available. TANF families are notresponsible for a co-payment for child care services in 22 states. Federal law requires states to assure that payment rates to child care providers ensure that CCDF-eligible children receive equal access to care comparable to that available to children noteligible for subsidies. States generally set payment rates based on prevailing market rates for childcare. The most recent state plans indicate that 45 states (or territories) based their current paymentrates on market rate surveys conducted in 2000 or 2001; and rates of the remaining seven states werebased on surveys conducted in or prior to 1999. Federal law also requires that states use not less than 4% of federal child care funds made available for each fiscal year to administer activities designed to improve the quality of child care. Prior to 1996, the CCDBG Act included a list of activities for which the quality improvement fundswere to be spent; however, those categories are no longer itemized in law. Nevertheless, as part ofthe CCDF plan, states indicate whether they will spend any of their child care quality funds onactivities that fall into those categories authorized under prior law (and any others)."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nUnder the provisions of Title XVI of the Social Security Act, disabled individuals and persons who are 65 or older are entitled to benefits from the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program if they have income and assets that fall below program guidelines. SSI benefits are paid out of the general revenue of the United States and all participants receive the same basic monthly federal benefit. In most states, adults who collect SSI are automatically entitled to coverage under the Medicaid health insurance program. A participant in the SSI program receives the federal benefit rate (FBR), plus any state supplement, minus any countable income. At the end of June 2011, more than 8 million people received SSI benefits. In that month, these SSI beneficiaries each received an average cash benefit of $499.40 and the program paid out a total of nearly $4.3 billion in federally administered SSI benefits. The average monthly benefit is lower than the FBR because a person's final monthly benefit is based, in part, on his or her earnings and other income. Individuals and couples must have limited assets or resources to qualify for SSI benefits. Resources are defined by regulation as \"cash or other liquid assets or any real or personal property that an individual (or spouse, if any) owns and could convert to cash to be used for his or her support and maintenance.\" The countable resource limit for SSI eligibility is $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. These limits are set by law, are not indexed for inflation, and have been at their current levels since 1989. Not all resources are counted for the purposes of determining SSI eligibility. The Social Security Act and federal regulations provide various types of resource exclusions that allow individuals or couples to own certain assets and not have them counted against their $2,000 or $3,000 resource limit. In addition, the laws governing several federal benefit programs, including the Food Stamp program, prohibit the Social Security Administration (SSA) from counting benefits paid under these programs as resources when determining SSI eligibility. The following section of this report will detail the four types of accounts that a person or couple may have money in and not have that money counted as a resource for the purposes of determining their SSI eligibility. Money set aside by an SSI recipient to pay for his or her burial expenses can be excluded from the SSI resource limits. Each person may set aside up to $1,500 for burial expenses and these expenses must be separately identifiable from other assets and money held. A burial plot owned by an individual or a couple is not considered a resource and its value is not counted against the $2,000 or $3,000 resource limit. There are two cases in which the amount of the burial expense exclusion may be reduced. First, the total amount permitted to be excluded is reduced by the face value of all life insurance policies held by the individual or his or her spouse. The face value of a policy is the amount the insurer agrees to pay the beneficiary upon the death of the insured. Second, the excluded amount of burial expenses is reduced by the total amount of money held in an irrevocable trust (commonly called an irrevocable burial trust) available to meet the burial expenses of the individual or his or her spouse. Under the provisions of the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999, P.L. 106 - 169 , the corpus , or total value, of any trust established by an individual is counted as a resource when determining SSI eligibility unless there is no circumstance under which a payment from the trust could ever be made for the benefit of the individual or the individual's spouse. Nearly all trusts, even irrevocable burial trusts, trusts deemed irrevocable under state law and trusts with specific exculpatory clauses exempting the trust from parts of the Social Security Act, are covered by this provision and the entire value of the corpora of these trusts is counted as a resource. While most irrevocable burial trusts are not excluded from the SSI resource rules, the value of the corpora of these trusts is still used to reduce the amount of the burial expense exclusion. A Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS) is an individual plan for employment designed by an SSI beneficiary. An SSI beneficiary designs his or her own PASS, usually with the assistance of a state Vocational Rehabilitation agency, disability service organization or Ticket to Work Employment Network. The plan must be submitted in writing to the SSA and must be approved by a special network of SSA employees called the PASS Cadre. A PASS must include a specific goal for employment, such as a specific job type desired or a plan for setting up a small business. In addition, a PASS must include a time line for achieving the employment goal. The PASS must also include a list of any goods, such as assistive devices or job-specific tools, or services, such as schooling, that will be needed by the beneficiary to achieve his or her goal and must include a time line for the use of these goods or services and their cost. Resources included in an approved PASS are not counted against the SSI resource limits. There is no limit to the amount of resources that can be excluded as part of a PASS and these resources can include money set aside to pay for elements of the PASS such as training or items purchased as part of the PASS such as assistive technology devices. If a beneficiary does not fulfill the terms of the PASS, then these resources can be counted and he or she may lose SSI eligibility and be required to reimburse the SSA for benefits paid after eligibility was lost. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) are matched savings accounts that allow families and persons with low-incomes to set aside money for education, the purchase of a home, or the creation of a business. An individual may place money from his or her earnings into an IDA and have that amount of money matched by the state with funds from the state's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. In addition, under the provisions of the Assets for Independence Act, P.L. 105 - 285 , nonprofit organizations, and state, local, or tribal governments may compete for grants to fund IDAs for low-income households. IDAs funded through this grant process are often referred to as Demonstration Project IDAs. Money saved in a TANF IDA or a Demonstration Project IDA, including the state contribution and any interest earned, is not counted as a resource for the purposes of determining SSI eligibility. There is no limit to the amount of money in an IDA that can be excluded from the SSI resource calculation. However, there are limits to the amounts states and other entities can contribute to IDAs. When a child SSI beneficiary is owed back SSI benefits of more than six months, his or her representative payee is required to place those benefits in a dedicated account at a financial institution. This dedicated account must be in the child's name and can not be invested in stocks, bonds, or other types of securities. Any money placed in the account and any interest earned on the account is the property of the child. The representative payee may use the money from the dedicated account for the medical care or education and training needs of the child. In addition, money from this account can be used for personal needs assistance, special equipment, housing modifications, or therapy for the child based on his or her disability or for other items and services for the child approved in advance by the SSA. Money from a dedicated account can not be used for the daily expenses, food, clothing, or shelter of the child. The representative payee is responsible for keeping records and receipts of all deposits and expenditures and is liable to the SSA for any misuse of money in a dedicated account. Money in a dedicated account for children is not counted as a resource for the purposes of determining the child's SSI eligibility or the SSI eligibility of the representative payee.", "completion": "response:\nAs a means tested program, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) places a limit on the assets or resources of its beneficiaries. However, there are four types of accounts that can be used by SSI beneficiaries for specific purposes without affecting their SSI eligibility. Money placed into burial accounts, money used as part of a Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS), money placed in Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), and money placed in dedicated accounts for children are not counted as resources for the purposes of determining SSI eligibility. These accounts can be used by SSI beneficiaries to build assets or plan for the future and represent an important part of the overall SSI program. This report provides an overview of these four types of accounts and outlines the cases when money placed into these accounts is exempt from the SSI resource limitations. This report will be updated to reflect any changes in this legislation or other relevant legislative activity."}

The act establishes a new regulator for corporate auditors, the Public Company AccountingOversight Board, which is to be supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The actrestricts accounting firms from performing a number of other services for the companies they auditand requires new disclosures for public companies and the officers and directors of those companies. Other issues affected by the new legislation are securities fraud, criminal and civil penalties forviolating the securities laws and other laws, blackout periods for insider trades of pension fundshares, and protections for corporate whistleblowers. The ongoing criminal prosecutions are a complementary phase of the effort to improvecorporate accountability. Many observers maintain that prosecution of individuals alleged to haveabused the public trust, together with new legal and regulatory standards for corporate behavior, iscrucial to restoring investor confidence in the fairness and transparency of the public securitiesmarkets. Table 1 identifies firms and individuals associated with a number of high-profile casesagainst whom criminal charges have been filed by federal prosecutors since the collapse of EnronCorp.

IHS provides health care for approximately 2.2 million eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives through a system of programs and facilities located on or near Indian reservations, and through contractors in certain urban areas. IHS provides services to members of 573 federally recognized tribes. It provides services either directly or through facilities and programs operated by Indian tribes or tribal organizations through self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts authorized in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA). The Snyder Act of 1921 provides general statutory authority for IHS. In addition, specific IHS programs are authorized by two acts: the Indian Sanitation Facilities Act of 1959 and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). The Indian Sanitation Facilities Act authorizes the IHS to construct sanitation facilities for Indian communities and homes. IHCIA authorizes programs such as urban health, health professions recruitment, and substance abuse and mental health treatment, and permits IHS to receive reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and third-party insurers. Finally, the Public Health Service Act provides funds for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians grants administered by IHS. The IHS has three major sources of funding, described here in order of magnitude: (1) discretionary appropriations, (2) collections, and (3) mandatory appropriations. Unlike most agencies within HHS, which receive their appropriations through the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations act, the IHS receives its discretionary appropriations through the Interior/Environment appropriations act. IHS's discretionary appropriations are divided into three accounts: (1) Indian Health Services, (2) Contract Support Costs, and (3) Indian Health Facilities. As a second source of funding, IHS collects and expends funds received as payment for health services provided. IHS has the authority to receive payments from other federal programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. IHS also receives payments from state programs (such as workers compensation) and from private insurance. IHS, under its IHCIA collection authority, is able to retain these payments to increase services available to its beneficiaries. In addition to these collections, IHS collects rent from facilities it owns. The third and smallest source of IHS funding is a mandatory appropriation of $150 million annually to support the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. This mandatory funding was extended through FY2019 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018, P.L. 115-123 ). The President's budget request proposes to shift the FY2019 appropriation to discretionary funding. Table 1 presents IHS's funding from FY2014 through the proposed President's FY2019 budget submission. The table generally shows increases in both appropriated funds and funds collected by IHS through FY2018. The table presents IHS's three budget accounts—Indian Health Services, Contract Support Costs, and Indian Health Facilities—and the funds collected and allocated to programs under these accounts. Collections and proposed and actual mandatory funding are subtracted from program-level funding to show the agency's discretionary budget authority. Although appropriations for IHS have increased over time, the FY2018 appropriation represents a larger increase than in prior years. In particular, the FY2018 appropriation included increases for a number of programs funded under the Indian Health Facilities account, which includes maintenance and improvement and construction of new facilities. In addition, the FY2018 appropriation increased funding for mental health and alcohol and substance abuse services, provided new funding for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund, and included language to require IHS to conduct an analysis of IHS locations and services relative to the IHS user population. The FY2019 President's request represents a decrease from FY2018 levels for a number of IHS programs and activities. However, final FY2018 appropriations had not been enacted during the period in which the FY2019 President's request was being formulated. While the total request for IHS represents a decrease from FY2018-enacted levels, it represents an increase from FY2017-enacted levels and the FY2018 annualized continuing resolution levels that were in place at the time the FY2018 request levels were being determined. IHS facilities collect payments from third-party payors for services provided to IHS beneficiaries who are also enrolled in other programs. These collections are an important source of IHS's clinical services (see Table 1 ). Medicaid is the largest source of IHS's collections—accounting for approximately 68% of all third-party collections in FY2017, the most recent year of final data available—followed by Medicare (21% in FY2017) and private insurance (9% in FY2017). Beginning in FY2014, IHS began receiving payments from the VA for services provided to IHS beneficiaries who were also enrolled in the VA (these payments were 2% of all of IHS's third-party collections in FY2017).

Since FY1998, IHS has received a mandatory appropriation each fiscal year to support the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. This funding source was most recently extended in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which provided mandatory appropriations for FY2018 and FY2019. The President's budget requests that these funds be moved to discretionary appropriations in FY2019. This fact sheet focuses on the funding that IHS has received between FY2014 and FY2019 (proposed)."}

All House vacancies are filled by special election. Scheduling for special elections is largely dependent upon the amount of time remaining beforethenext regular elections for the House. When a vacancy occurs during the first session of Congress, a special electionisalways scheduled for the earliest possible time, preferably to coincide with elections regularly scheduled for otherpurposes in the district. If, however, a seat becomes vacant within six months of the end of a Congress, some states hold a special election forthe balance of the congressional term on the same day as the regular election. Winners of special elections in thesecases are sometimes not sworn in immediately as Members of the House, Congress having often adjourned sine die before election day.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act, P.L. 93-288 ) authorizes the President to issue major disaster declarations in response to certain incidents that overwhelm the capabilities of tribal, state, and local governments. The Stafford Act defines a major disaster as any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this chapter to supplement the efforts and available resources of states, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby. Major disaster declarations can authorize several types of federal assistance to support response and recovery efforts following an incident. The primary source of funding for federal assistance following a major disaster is the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). While this fund also provides assistance as a result of emergency declarations and Fire Management Assistance Grants, major disaster declarations historically account for the majority of obligations from the DRF. This report provides a national overview of actual and projected obligations funded through the DRF as a result of major disaster declarations between FY2000 and FY2015. In addition to providing a national overview, the electronic version of this report includes links to CRS products that summarize actual and projected obligations from the DRF as a result of major disaster declarations in each state and the District of Columbia. Each state profile includes information on the most costly incidents and impacted localities. In both the national and state-level products, information is provided on the types of assistance that have been provided for major disasters. Many other federal programs that provide assistance following a major disaster are not funded through the DRF. While the specific agencies and programs called upon will vary from one disaster to another, an overview of selected programs can be found in CRS Report R42845, Federal Emergency Management: A Brief Introduction , coordinated by [author name scrubbed]. A total of 936 major disaster declarations were made between FY2000 and FY2015. These declarations resulted in more than $133.6 billion in actual and projected obligations from the DRF. There was a high level of variation in the amount of actual and projected funding obligated for major disasters each year, with more than $48.6 billion in actual and projected obligations for disasters in FY2005 alone. Figure 1 displays the actual and projected obligations for all major disaster declarations each fiscal year. In Figure 1 , obligations associated with each declaration are reported in the fiscal year in which the major disaster was declared. However, disaster response and recovery expenses are often incurred over several years following an incident, including some of the incidents from FY2000 to FY2015. To account for the total amount of federal assistance ultimately obligated for major disasters, the obligations data used throughout this report reflect actual obligations as well as obligations projected under FEMA-approved spending plans. A major disaster declaration can authorize funding for different purposes, depending on the needs of the state. These purposes include the following: Public Assistance , which is used by tribal, state, or local governments, or certain private nonprofit organizations to provide emergency protective services, conduct debris removal operations, and repair or replace damaged public infrastructure; Individual Assistance , which provides direct aid to impacted households; Hazard Mitigation Assistance , which funds mitigation and resiliency projects and programs, typically across the entire state; FEMA administrative costs associated with each disaster declaration; and Mission Assignment , which tasks and reimburses other federal entities that provide direct disaster assistance. The decision concerning which types of assistance to provide is made either when the major disaster is declared or when the declaration is amended. For many major disasters, all of the assistance types outlined above are authorized. For others, some assistance types are not authorized. Figure 2 compares the actual and projected obligations for different types of assistance provided as a result of a major disaster declaration from FY2000 to FY2015. In addition to the major disaster assistance described above, there are other forms of assistance that are funded through the DRF. These include assistance associated with Emergency Declarations and with Fire Management Assistance Grants. The funding associated with these types of assistance typically results in lower obligation levels than assistance provided as a result of major disaster declarations, although there is significant variation across incidents. Emergency Declarations are often made at the time a threat is recognized in order to assist tribal, state, and local efforts prior to an incident. For the period FY2000 through FY2015, total obligations for emergency declarations were just over $2.37 billion. Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs) provide aid for the control, management, and mitigation of fires. Total obligations for FMAGs from FY2000 through FY2015 were slightly more than $1.21 billion. Floods represent a majority of all major disaster declarations nationwide. One of the primary sources of assistance for flooding events is the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is not funded through the DRF. For more information on the NFIP, please refer to CRS Report R44593, Introduction to FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThis report briefly poses and answers several frequently asked questions in relation to the floor proceedings used to elect a Speaker of the House. For a more detailed treatment of these election procedures, as well as data on elections of the Speaker in each Congress since 1913, see CRS Report RL30857, Speakers of the House: Elections, 1913-2017 . For a list of all Speakers of the House and their periods of service, as well as additional discussion of selection procedures, see CRS Report 97-780, The Speaker of the House: House Officer, Party Leader, and Representative . Upon convening at the start of a new Congress, the House elects a Speaker by roll call vote. If a Speaker dies, resigns, or is removed during a Congress, the House elects a new Speaker at that time. In the most recent cases of an election held during the middle of a Congress, the practice has been to elect a new Speaker using the same process as at the start of a Congress. When a Speaker is selected at the start of a new Congress, the Clerk of the House presides; the Clerk may also preside over an election to replace a Speaker who had died during a Congress. A sitting Speaker could preside over the election of his or her successor. However, under clause 8(b)(3) of House Rule I (adopted in the 108 th Congress), the Speaker must provide the Clerk a list of Members designated to act as Speaker pro tempore in the case of a vacancy in the office. It is possible that a Member on this list could preside over an election in the case of a vacancy during a Congress. In current practice, each House party caucus selects, prior to the floor vote, a candidate whose name is placed in nomination immediately before the vote. Typically, the election commences with a Member from each party caucus placing in nomination the party's candidate for Speaker. Other names may also be placed in nomination on the floor. Since 1839, the election has been by roll-call vote, a quorum being present. Votes are cast v iva voce , meaning that each voting Member states aloud the surname of the candidate whom he or she favors for Speaker. The presiding officer appoints several Members as tellers, who tally the votes. Members are not required to vote for one of the candidates nominated by each major party (or even for some other candidate formally nominated on the floor); they may vote for any individual. Although the U.S. Constitution does not require the Speaker to be a Member of the House, all Speakers have been Members. However, some individuals not serving in the House have received votes. The long-standing practice of the House is that electing a Speaker requires a numerical majority of the votes cast by Members \"for a person by name.\" This does not mean that an individual must necessarily receive a majority (currently 218) of the full membership of the House, because some Members may not be present to vote (or may instead answer \"present\"). If no candidate receives the requisite majority of votes cast, the roll call is repeated. No restrictions are imposed on who may receive votes in the subsequent ballots. (For instance, no candidate is eliminated based on receiving the fewest votes in the floor election, and a Member's vote is not limited to individuals who received votes in previous ballots. )", "completion": "response:\nThis report briefly poses and answers several \"frequently asked questions\" in relation to the floor proceedings used to elect a Speaker of the House. Current practice for electing a Speaker, either at the start of a Congress or in the event of a vacancy (e.g., death or resignation), is by roll-call vote, during which Members state aloud the name of their preferred candidate. Members may vote for any individual. If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, balloting continues; in subsequent ballots, Members may still vote for any individual.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, Title XVI of the Social Security Act, was enacted in 1972 and implemented in 1974 to assure a minimum cash income to all aged, blind, or disabled persons. SSI is provided to eligible aged or disabled individuals or couples who have limited income and resources. For adults, disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or last at least 12 months. In general, the worker must be unable to do any kind of work that exists in the national economy, taking into account age, education, and work experience. A child under the age of 18 may qualify as disabled if he or she has an impairment that results in \"marked and severe\" functional limitations. Adults aged 65 or older may qualify for SSI benefits without being disabled. SSI is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and operates in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. To qualify for SSI, a person must be a citizen of the United States or a \"qualified alien\" and either a resident of the United States or the Northern Mariana Islands, a child of a person in the military stationed outside the United States, or a student temporarily abroad. Other requirements related to residence in certain public institutions, absence from the United States, filing for other potential benefits, and fugitive felon and probation/parole violator status also apply. In December 2013, the SSI program had more than 8.3 million recipients, who received over $4.6 billion in benefit payments. Of these recipients, more than 1.3 million were children under the age of 18, almost 5.0 million were adults between the ages of 18 and 64, and just over 2.1 million were adults aged 65 or older. The maximum federal SSI payment, referred to as the federal benefit rate, is $721 per month for an individual living independently and $1,082 for a couple living independently in 2014. All but six states and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands supplement the federal SSI benefit with additional payments. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have state supplements that are either partially or wholly administered by the SSA, and 34 states self-administer their supplements. Federal SSI benefit maximums are adjusted annually using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) to reflect changes in the cost of living. After a 1.7% increase in 2013, a 1.5% COLA was applied for 2014. Most SSI recipients have other income; their countable income is subtracted from the federal benefit rate to determine their SSI eligibility and payment amount. In calculating countable income, SSI provides for certain income exclusions (e.g., the first $20 of monthly unearned income; the first $65 plus one-half of remaining monthly earned income). In December 2013, the average monthly federally administered SSI payment was $630.98 for children under the age of 18, $546.38 for adults aged 18 to 64, and $425.09 for adults aged 65 or older. SSA generally sends the monthly SSI payments directly to the recipient. However, SSA assigns representative payees to (1) minors, (2) individuals incapable of physically or mentally managing their own benefits, and (3) individuals declared legally incompetent by a court. SSI recipients living alone or in households in which all members receive SSI benefits are also automatically eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In most cases an SSI recipient is eligible for Medicaid. The SSI program generally counts all types of income in determining eligibility and payment amounts. In some cases, the income and resources of non-recipients are counted in determining SSI eligibility and benefit amounts. This process is called \"deeming\" and is applied in cases in which an eligible child lives with an ineligible parent, an eligible individual lives with an ineligible spouse, or an eligible non-citizen has a sponsor. In general, an SSI recipient can have assets, with the exception of a home, car, and household items, worth no more than $2,000 and beneficiary-couples can have countable assets worth no more than $3,000. Federal SSI benefits and administrative costs are paid from federal general revenues and state supplements are paid from state funds. For FY2013, the net cost of the SSI program (including administrative expenses and benefit payments) was 53.2 billion. Funding for the SSI program is provided by Congress in the annual Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies appropriations bill.", "completion": "response:\nThe Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, enacted in 1974, is a needs-based program that provides cash benefits designed to ensure a minimum income to aged, blind, or disabled persons with limited income and assets.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nH.R. 157 / S. 160 , the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 introduced in the 111 th Congress, provided for a permanent increase in the size of the U.S. House of Representatives, from 435 seats to 437 seats. The bills specified that one of the additional seats was to be allocated to the District of Columbia while the other seat was to be assigned either by using the normal apportionment formula allocation procedure ( H.R. 157 ) or specifying that the seat would be allocated to Utah, the state which would have received the 436 th seat under the 2000 apportionment process. Thus, this would add a fourth seat to Utah's three ( S. 160 ). While both versions treated the District of Columbia as if it were a state for the purposes of the allocation of House seats, each bill restricted the District of Columbia to a single congressional seat under any future apportionments. Similar bills had been introduced in the 110 th Congress. On April 19, 2007, the House approved H.R. 1905 (a revised version of H.R. 1433 ) by a vote of 241 to 177 (Roll Call vote 231) and sent it to the Senate for consideration. On June 28, 2007, S. 1257 was reported out of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs with amendments. On September 18, 2007, cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of the measure was not invoked in the Senate on a Yea-Nay vote, 57 - 42, leaving the measure pending. No further action occurred on the legislation. The 435 seat limit for the size of the House was imposed in 1929 by statute (46 Stat. 21, 26-27). Altering the size of the House would require a new law setting a different limit. Article I, §2 of the Constitution establishes a minimum House size (one Representative for each state), and a maximum House size (one for every 30,000 persons, or 10,306 representatives based on the 2010 Census). For the 2010 apportionment, a House size of 468 would have resulted in no state losing seats held from the 112 th to the 116 th Congresses. However, by retaining seats through such an increase in the House size, other state delegations would become larger. At a House size of 468, California's delegation size, for example, would be 56 instead of 53 seats, Texas's delegation size would be 38 instead of 36 seats, and Florida's delegation size would be 29 instead of 27 seats. General congressional practice when admitting new states to the Union has been to increase the size of the House, either permanently or temporarily, to accommodate the new states. New states usually resulted in additions to the size of the House in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. The exceptions to this general rule occurred when states were formed from other states (Maine, Kentucky, and West Virginia). These states' Representatives came from the allocations of Representatives of the states from which the new ones had been formed. When Alaska and Hawaii were admitted in 1959 and 1960 the House size was temporarily increased to 437. This modern precedent differed from the state admission acts passed following the censuses in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries which provided that new state representatives would be added to the apportionment totals. The apportionment act of 1911 anticipated the admission of Arizona and New Mexico by providing for an increase in the House size from 433 to 435 if the states were admitted. As noted above, the House size was temporarily increased to 437 to accommodate Alaska and Hawaii in 1960. In 1961, when the President reported the 1960 census results and the resulting reapportionment of seats in the reestablished 435-seat House, Alaska was entitled to one seat, and Hawaii to two seats. Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Missouri each received one less seat than they would have if the House size had been increased to 438 (as was proposed by H.R. 10264, in 1962). Table 1 , below displays the apportionment of the seats in the House of Representatives based on the 2000 Census apportionment population (the current House apportionment) and the apportionment of seats in the House based on the 2010 Census apportionment population (the distribution of seats among the states for the 113 th Congress). In addition, Table 1 also shows the impact on the distribution of seats in the House if the District of Columbia were to be treated as if it were a state for apportionment purposes for both a House size of 435 seats and a House size of 437 seats. First, due to population changes between the 2000 Census and the 2010 Census, Table 1 shows a shift of 12 seats among 18 states for the 113 th Congress (beginning in January 2013). Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania will each lose one seat; New York and Ohio will each lose two seats. Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington will each gain one seat; Florida will gain two seats; and Texas will gain four seats. These are the actual seats to be allocated based on the results of the 2010 Census. Second, if the District of Columbia were to be given a vote in the House of Representatives and treated as if it were a state in the reapportionment of congressional seats following the 2010 census, and the House size remained at 435, Minnesota would lose a seat relative to what it is scheduled to get as a result of the 2010 Census. Thus, Minnesota's delegation would fall to seven Representatives if the District of Columbia were to given a vote and the House size remained at 435 Representatives. Third, if, on the other hand, the District of Columbia were to be given a vote in the House of Representatives and treated as if it were a state and the House size were to be increased to 437, the District of Columbia would receive one Representative and North Carolina would be entitled to fourteen Representatives, one more than the state is scheduled to receive in the apportionment following the 2010 census. Also, Minnesota would retain its eighth seat and no other state would be affected by the change. Another way to see the impact is to examine the allocation of the last seats assigned to the states when the District of Columbia is allocated a seat (presumably the 51 st seat). The actual apportionment is done through a \"priority list\" calculated using the equal proportions formula provided in 2 U.S.C. §2a.(a). Table 2 , below, displays the end of the priority list that was used to allocate Representatives based on the 2010 Census, including the District of Columbia. The law only provides for 435 seats in the House, but the table illustrates not only the last seats assigned by the apportionment formula (ending at 435), but the states that would just miss getting additional representation. Table 3 is similar to Table 2 , in that it displays the end of the priority list, but the last seat is 437 instead of 435. The priority values and the population needed to gain or lose a seat do not change if DC is treated like state, as DC is entitled the constitutional minimum of one Representative.", "completion": "response:\nTwo proposals (H.R. 157/S. 160, District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009) were introduced in the 111th Congress to provide for voting representation in the U.S. House of Representatives for the residents of the District of Columbia (DC). H.R. 157/S. 160, for purposes of voting representation, treated the District of Columbia as if it were a state, giving a House seat to the District, but restricting it to a single seat under any future apportionments. The bills also increased the size of the House to 437 members from 435, and gave the additional seat to the state that would have received the 436th seat under the 2000 apportionment, Utah. This report shows the distribution of House seats based on the 2010 Census for 435 seats and for 437 seats as specified in the proposal. North Carolina, which would receive the 436th seat in the 2010 apportionment is substituted for Utah, assuming that any new, similar legislation would adopt the same language as H.R. 157."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction which describes a task, paired with an input which will provide further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nIn 2006, expenditures on energy-related goods and services represented nearly 10% of total expenditures for older households. There are two main components of energy expenditures. Over half (57%) are for utilities and fuel to operate, heat, and cool homes; the remaining 43% are for gasoline and motor oil. Within the category of utilities and fuel, electricity comprises the largest share of spending, representing nearly two-thirds (62.8%) of this category. Second is natural gas (27.6%), and the remaining 9.6% are petroleum-based fuels like fuel oil and propane. However, the reliance on certain fuels varies widely by geographic region. Natural gas is the most commonly used source in the Northeast (55%), Midwest (79%) and West (66%), while electricity is the most commonly used source in the South (52%). In the Northeast, heating oil is also a significant fuel source, where it is reported second to natural gas as a primary fuel source (see Table 1 ). Petroleum-based products like fuel oil, propane, and gasoline comprise about 50% of household energy expenditures. Increases in costs in this category reflect the significant increases in the price of crude oil over the past five years. Over the past five years, the price per barrel of crude oil has risen nearly 200%. Over the same period, prices charged to consumers for petroleum-based energy costs (energy commodities) increased 117%, while prices charged for energy services increased 38% (see Table 2 ). Growth in overall energy spending is driven by two key factors: the price charged to the consumer and the quantity demanded. Energy prices to consumers have increased 70% between 2000 and 2007 as compared to a 20% rise in overall prices over the same time period. More recently, in 2007, overall energy prices rose 17.4% as compared to a 4.1% rise in overall prices (see Table 2 ). In fact, the increase in energy prices in December of 2007 accounted for about one-third of the overall CPI increase in that month. Beyond the direct effect of rising energy prices on household spending, there are also indirect effects on overall consumer prices that must be taken into account. All of the non-energy goods and services consumed by households rely to some degree on energy for their production. It takes energy to run a plant, and gasoline to fuel trucks and other forms of transport to take goods to the store to sell. Higher energy prices to manufacturers may be passed through to the consumer and thus increase overall inflation rates of goods and services. The consumer price index, excluding energy, has been rising in recent years, increasing from 1.5% in 2003 to 2.8% in 2007, suggesting that higher energy prices are affecting other areas of consumption as well. Older households account for approximately 20% of our nation's total consumption on energy-related products. Yet, they are disproportionately affected by higher energy costs. Although in actual dollar terms older households spend slightly less on energy-related consumption than households headed by a person under age 65, they spend a higher share of their income on energy-related expenditures. As shown in Table 3 , in 2006, older households spent 9.5% of their income on energy-related services compared to 7.4% for younger households in 2006. Among older households, lower-income elderly spend significantly more as a share of income for energy-related services compared to those with higher incomes. Older households with less than $15,000 in household income spent approximately 20% of their income for energy-related expenditures, as compared to 7.3% for elderly households with incomes over $15,000 in 2006. For utilities and fuel, these same households spent 13% of their income to heat and operate their homes, compared to only 4.7% for older households with $15,000 or more in income (see Table 4 ). The $15,000 threshold for household income in Table 4 is a close approximation to older households that have incomes below or near 150% of poverty. The 150% of poverty threshold is used by current public programs that provide low-income energy assistance to households (see discussion below). In 2006, about 22% of older Americans had family incomes below 150% of the poverty thresholds. These estimates are for 2006 and do not reflect the additional 17% increase in energy prices that occurred in 2007. Over time, growth in energy expenditures has increased faster than income of older households (see Figure 1 ). However, among older households, the data indicate that energy-related spending for low-income households is not increasing as fast as overall energy prices or energy-related spending for higher-income households. Average annual energy-related spending for low-income households (after adjusting for inflation) has increased only 5.9% since 2000, compared to 20% for higher-income households (see Table 4 ). This difference may reflect lower-income households changing their behavior in response to rising energy costs. According to an AARP survey, older Americans with household incomes below $25,000 are significantly more likely to reduce their savings and other spending to offset higher gasoline prices. Other alternatives that households explore in response to rising energy costs have included replacing heating and cooling systems with more energy-efficient units, installing energy-efficient windows, and purchasing more fuel-efficient cars. Although these alternatives may save costs in the longer-run, many lower-income households do not have sufficient funds to purchase them. The key public program that provides energy assistance to low-income households is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LIHEAP was established in 1981 ( P.L. 97-35 ) and is a block grant program under which the federal government makes annual grants to states, territories, and tribes to operate home energy assistance programs for low-income households. The LIHEAP statute authorizes two types of funds: block grant funds, which are allocated to all states using a statutory formula, and contingency funds, which are allocated to one or more states at the discretion of the Administration. Federal law limits LIHEAP eligibility to households with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty guidelines (or, if greater, 60% of the state median income). States may adopt lower income limits, but no household with income below 110% of the poverty guidelines may be considered ineligible. In FY2004 (the most recent year for which data are available), 40% of low-income households eligible for LIHEAP had a member aged 60 or older. Over time, while energy costs have risen as a share of income, public programs like LIHEAP have faced declining funding. While utility and fuel expenditures have increased 34.6% from 2000 to 2005, the average benefit for LIHEAP has increased 12.6% over the same time period. These estimates do not include growth rates between 2005 and 2007, during which time energy prices increased another 20.8%. In the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 110-161 ), Congress appropriated $1.98 billion in LIHEAP funds and an additional $590 million in contingency funds. In the 110 th Congress, two bills have been introduced that would appropriate an additional $1 billion in LIHEAP contingency funds. Both bills, H.R. 4275 and S. 2405 , are entitled the \"Keeping Americans Warm Act.\" In addition, a number of bills have been introduced that would provide additional funds for LIHEAP through various means, including penalties collected from energy suppliers and profits from carbon allowance trading. S. 1238 , the \"Energy Security and Corporate Accountability Act of 2007,\" has also been introduced in the 110 th Congress and would allow low-income households eligible under the LIHEAP program to be eligible for state funds to assist them in paying transportation expenses associated with gasoline and motor oil purchases as well as public transportation.", "completion": "response:\nEnergy-related expenditures include spending for utilities and fuel to operate, heat, and cool homes and spending for gasoline and motor oil for private transportation. Energy prices to consumers have increased 70% between 2000 and 2007, driven largely by growth in prices for energy commodities such as petroleum. Petroleum-based products such as fuel oil, propane and gasoline comprise about 50% of household energy expenditures. Older Americans are disproportionately affected by higher energy costs. As a share of income, households headed by a person age 65 or older spend more on energy-related expenditures than their younger counterparts. In addition, low-income households (those with less than $15,000 in household income) spent nearly 20% of their household income on energy-related expenditures in 2006 (the latest year for which data are available). This compares to 7.3% spent by older households with incomes above $15,000. These estimates are for 2006 and do not reflect the additional 17% increase in energy prices that occurred in 2007. The key public program that provides energy assistance to low-income households is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Approximately 40% of low-income households that were eligible for LIHEAP have a household member aged 60 or older. Funding for the LIHEAP Program has not kept pace with recent increases in energy costs of older Americans. This report will explore the burden of rising energy costs on older Americans and discuss implications for public policies. This report will be updated when new data is released."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. What a court determines to be \"reasonable\" depends on the nature of the search and its underlying governmental purpose. This report provides an analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2009 decision, Safford Unified School District #1 v. Redding , which addressed the strip search of a 13-year-old middle school student. In October 2003, Savana Redding was a 13-year-old student at Safford Middle School. At the time, Kerry Wilson was Safford Middle School's assistant principal. Wilson confiscated four prescription strength ibuprofen, a single over-the-counter naproxen pain reliever, and a day planner from another student, Marissa Glines. Inside the day planner were multiple knives and lighters, and a cigarette. Glines indicated that she had received the pills and the day planner from Redding. The pills were not allowed on school premises without prior approval. A week prior to this incident, a different student told Wilson that students were carrying weapons on the school premises and dealing pills, and that he had become ill after taking a pill that he had received from a classmate. Wilson ordered Redding into his office and showed her the day planner with the contraband inside. Redding admitted that the planner was hers, but said that she had allowed Glines to borrow it a few days before. Redding denied ownership of the knives, lighters, and cigarette that were in the planner. Wilson then asked Redding about the pills and informed her that he had been told that Redding had been distributing these pills to other students. Redding told Wilson that she did not know anything about the pills and denied distributing them to others. Wilson then asked if he could search through Redding's book bag, which Redding allowed. A female assistant and Wilson searched the bag, but did not find any prohibited items. Wilson then ordered Redding to go to the nurse's office for the nurse and female assistant to search Redding's clothes for other pills. The two female school employees searched her outerwear and eventually had Redding remove her clothes down to her bra and underwear, at which point they required Redding \"to pull her bra out and to the side and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree.\" During the conduct of this search, the employees found no pills. Redding's mother subsequently sued the school and the three school employees involved, claiming they violated Redding's Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. Eight justices held that the search resulted in a violation of Savana Redding's Fourth Amendment rights. Generally speaking, the government is required by the Fourth Amendment to obtain warrants based on probable cause in order to effectuate constitutional searches and seizures. An exception to ordinary warrant requirements has gradually evolved, however, for cases where a \"special need\" of the government, unrelated to criminal law enforcement, is found by the courts to outweigh any \"diminished expectation\" of privacy invaded by a search. Even in circumstances where warrantless searches are permitted, they ordinarily \"must be based on 'probable cause' to believe that a violation of the law has occurred.\" Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has determined that neither a warrant nor probable cause is invariably required. In such situations, a Fourth Amendment standard based on a balancing test has been crafted by the Court. This \"special needs\" approach appears to confer optimal power on the government to search where \"compelling\" reason exists and correspondingly warrants less protection to the individual's \"diminished expectation of privacy.\" In New Jersey v. T.L.O. , the Court found that students are one group of individuals which has a \"diminished expectation of privacy.\" In that case, the Court held that, for searches conducted by school officials in the school setting, \"a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause.\" The Court went on to apply a \"reasonable suspicion\" standard for such a search and stated \"[a search] will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\" To determine if there is reasonable suspicion to warrant a school search, the courts generally look to three different factors: (1) \"the degree to which known facts imply prohibited conduct\"; (2) \"the specificity of the information received\"; and (3) \"the reliability of its source.\" However, these factors \"do not rigidly control,\" rather they are \"fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts in which they are being assessed.\" The Court went on: Perhaps the best that can be said generally about the required knowledge component of probable cause for a law enforcement officer's evidence search is that it raise a 'fair probability' or a 'substantial chance' of discovering evidence of criminal activity. The lesser standard for school searches could as readily be described as a moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing. Applying these standards, the Court held that the school's search of Redding's book bag and outer clothing was in accordance with the Fourth Amendment. The school had reasonable suspicion Redding was involved in pill distribution as a result of Gline's possession of banned pills; Gline's accusation of Redding; Redding's acknowledged ownership of the day planner; and circumstantial evidence that Redding had been involved in alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking at a school dance a month or two before. Additionally, the search of Redding's book bag and outer clothing were conducted in \"relative privacy ... and [were] not excessively intrusive.... \" The search became constitutionally unreasonable when it went beyond Redding's outerwear and ultimately led to Redding being required to shake and pull out her bra and underwear. The fact that the two school employees present testified that they did not see Redding's private areas was immaterial to the Court. It stated: The very fact of [Redding's] pulling her underwear away from her body in the presence of the two officials who were able to see her necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy support the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct elements of justification on the part of the school authorities.... Redding's subjective belief that the search was scary and humiliating was reasonable, as it was \"consistent [with] the experiences of other young people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability intensifies the patent intrusiveness of the exposure.\" In addition, Wilson knew that the pills found on Glines were common pain relievers, the strongest of which were equivalent to two Advil. There was no indication that the pills were being distributed in mass quantities or that single students were receiving a large number of pills. Additionally, there was no evidence supporting the belief that Redding was hiding pills in her underwear. Thus, the Court concluded, \"[w]e think that the combination of these deficiencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable.\" The Safford Court makes clear that, while students enjoy diminished privacy expectations and school administrators have a lower level of suspicion to eclipse, there are limits to when and how searches may be conducted in the school setting. However, ascertaining if a school administrator has encroached upon those constitutional limits will depend largely on the facts of the case.", "completion": "response:\nThe Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. What a court determines to be \"reasonable\" depends on the nature of the search and its underlying governmental purpose. This report provides an analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2009 decision, Safford Unified School District #1 v. Redding, which addressed the constitutionality of a strip search of a 13-year-old middle school student. Based on the facts of the case, the Court held that the school's search of a student's book bag and outer clothing was in accordance with the Fourth Amendment. However, as a result of a number of factual deficiencies, the search became constitutionally unreasonable when it went beyond the student's outerwear and ultimately led to the student being required to shake and pull out her bra and underwear.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nThe United States has an abundance of natural resources. For much of the nation's history, energy availability was not a concern as commerce and industry needs could be met by domestic supplies. However, industrialization and population growth, and the continuing development of a consumer-oriented society, led to growing dependence on foreign sources of energy during the 20 th century to supplement the demands of a growing economy. Recognition of the implications of dependence on foreign sources of energy, coupled with concerns over the volatility of prices driven by fluctuations in supply spurred by world events, prompted federal efforts to increase U.S. energy independence and reduce domestic consumption. A major result has been the establishment of a number of programs focused on energy efficiency and conservation of domestic resources and on research programs that target the development of renewable sources of energy. Many of these programs have roots going back almost 40 years and have been redesigned many times over that period. Many of the current programs have been reauthorized and redesigned periodically to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. The programs apply broadly to sectors ranging from industry to academia, and from state and local governments to rural communities. Each program has been designed to meet current needs as well as future anticipated challenges. Since 2005, Congress has enacted several major energy laws: the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005; P.L. 109-58 ); the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P.L. 110-140 ); the Energy Improvement and Extension Act (EIEA), enacted as Division B of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA; P.L. 110-343 ); and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ). Each of those laws established, expanded, or modified energy efficiency and renewable energy research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&D) programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) operates the greatest number of efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs. The Department of the Treasury and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) operate several programs. A few programs can also be found among the Departments of the Interior (DOI), Labor (DOL), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Small Business Administration (SBA). This report outlines current federal programs and provisions providing grants, loans, loan guarantees, and other direct or indirect incentives for energy efficiency, energy conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D. The programs are grouped by administering agency with references to applicable federal agency websites. Incentives are summarized and indexed in the appendixes. Most program descriptions were compiled from authorizing statutes, the U.S. Code, and Administration budget request documents. Other program descriptions and some funding information were compiled from The Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE), the Assistance Listings (formerly the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance or CFDA) housed on the beta.SAM.gov website , and the Energy Star website. Most budgetary figures were compiled from executive agency budget justifications and congressional committee reports.

Summary of Expired Federal Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Incentives/Index of Programs", "completion": "response:\nEnergy is crucial to the operation of a modern industrial and services economy. Concerns about the availability and cost of energy and about environmental impacts of fossil energy use have led to the establishment of a wide variety of federal incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency. These incentives are aimed at the implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures and the development and commercialization of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. Many of the existing energy efficiency and renewable energy programs have authorizations tracing back to the 1970s. Many of the programs have been reauthorized and redesigned repeatedly to meet changing economic factors. The programs apply broadly to sectors ranging from industry to academia, and from state and local governments to rural communities.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\ninstruction:\n\nSummarize the report provided below.\n\ninput:\n\nT his report answers several common questions about the regulation of social media accounts in the House of Representatives. Recently, the number of Member offices adopting social media as an official communications tool has increased. With the increased use of social media accounts for official representational duties, the House has adopted policies and regulations regarding the creation, content, and use of third-party social media services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Vine, YouTube, Instagram, and Flickr. The Committee on House Administration defines social media accounts in its policies on Member websites in the Members' Congressional Handbook . Social media accounts are \"profiles, pages, channels or any similar presence on third-party sites that allow individuals or organizations to offer information about themselves to the public.\" Websites on the house.gov domain are not considered social media accounts. The Committee on House Administration has issued policies on the use of websites and the Internet, including what can and cannot be included on websites and official social media accounts. The Members' Congressional Handbook specifies that Members may \"establish profiles, pages, channels or other similar presence on third-party sites ... ,\" so long as Members ensure that their official position (i.e., representative, congressman, congresswoman) is clearly stated in the account name. Further, all information provided on Member-controlled social media accounts \"is subject to the same requirements as content on Member websites.\" Therefore, material posted on official Member social media accounts \"must be in compliance with Federal law and House Rules and regulations applicable to official communications and germane to the conduct of the Member's official and representational duties.\" According to the House Ethics Manual , an official resource uses \"funds appropriated for Member, committee, and other House officers ... including goods and services purchased with those funds.\" The House Ethics Manual includes staff time as an official resource of the House. Therefore, social media accounts established by a Member or his or her office to communicate information as part of the Member's representational or legislative capacity are official resources of the House. Members are free to maintain non-official social media accounts, such as campaign or personal accounts. Such accounts are not subject to House rules or regulations regarding official social media accounts. These non-official accounts may not utilize official resources. Likewise, the Members' Congressional Handbook also provides that non-official resources such as campaign funds may not be used to pay for official social media accounts. Yes. Members may use official funds from their Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) for ordinary and necessary expenses associated with the creation and continued operation of official websites. The creation of profiles, pages, channels, or any similar presence on third-party sites that allow individuals or organizations to offer information about themselves to the public is covered under these regulations. As described in the Members' Congressional Handbook , \"Member-controlled content on social media accounts is subject to the same requirements as content on Member website.\" Content posted on Member websites (and thus social media accounts) must be germane to the conduct of the Member's official and representational duties. Official websites (and thus social media accounts) may not be used for campaign or personal purposes; may not generate, circulate, or otherwise encourage petitions; may not include advertisements or any private person or entity or imply government endorsement of a product or service; may not include grassroots lobbying; and must be in compliance with federal law and House rules and regulations applicable to official communications. Yes and no. As described in the Members' Congressional Handbook , \"Member-controlled content on social media accounts is subject to the same requirements as content on Member website.\" Accessing a Member website (and thus accessing an official social media account) is treated as a \"solicited communication\" from a Member's office, and is specifically exempted from restrictions on unsolicited mass communications. Therefore, regulations regarding unsolicited mass communications (such as the need for an advisory opinion, quarterly disclosure in the Statement of Disbursements , and the prohibition of sending such communications during the 90-day pre-election period) are not applicable to social media accounts. The content of solicited communications, however, must still comply with applicable federal laws and House rules and regulations.", "completion": "response:\nRecently, the number of Member offices adopting social media as an official communications tool has increased.
