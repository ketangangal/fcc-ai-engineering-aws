# Embeddings for NLP

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating practical implementations of embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The notebook (`embeddings-for-nlp.ipynb`) provides hands-on examples and explanations of embedding concepts.

## Overview

Embeddings are fundamental to modern NLP, allowing us to represent words and tokens as dense vectors that capture semantic relationships. This notebook provides a practical exploration of embedding concepts, from basic implementations to more advanced techniques.

## Contents

The notebook covers:
- Basic concepts of word embeddings
- Implementation of embedding layers
- Techniques for working with embeddings
- Practical examples and visualizations

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- PyTorch
- NumPy

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Open `embeddings-for-nlp.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
