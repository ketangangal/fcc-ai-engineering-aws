were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We
used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [31]. These hyperparameters
were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during
inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].
Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model
architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of ﬂoating point operations used to train a
model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained
