much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized
matrix multiplication code.
While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms
dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of
dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has
extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by
1
√dk .

Multi-Head Attention
Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,
