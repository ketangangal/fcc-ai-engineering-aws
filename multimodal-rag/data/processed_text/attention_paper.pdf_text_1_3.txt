The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difÔ¨Åcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is
