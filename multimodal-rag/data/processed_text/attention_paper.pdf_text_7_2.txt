On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)
in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0
BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The conÔ¨Åguration of this model is
listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model
surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of
the competitive models.
On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,
