the matrix of outputs as:
Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-
plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor
of
1
√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with
a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is
much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized
matrix multiplication code.
