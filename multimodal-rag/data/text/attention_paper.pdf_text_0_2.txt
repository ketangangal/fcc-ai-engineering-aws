chieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-
to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including
ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,
our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after
training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the
best models from the literature.

Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks
in particular, have been Ô¨Årmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5]. Numero
